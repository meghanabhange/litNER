    "PART ONE CHAPTER I THE EARLY MARRIED LIFE OF THE MORELS “ THE BOTTOMS ” succeeded to “ Hell Row ” .\nHell Row was a block of thatched , bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill Lane .\nThere lived the colliers who worked in the little gin-pits two fields away .\nThe brook ran under the alder trees , scarcely soiled by these small mines , whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin .\nAnd all over the countryside were these same pits , some of which had been worked in the time of Charles II , the few colliers and the donkeys burrowing down like ants into the earth , making queer mounds and little black places among the corn-fields and the meadows .\nAnd the cottages of these coal-miners , in blocks and pairs here and there , together with odd farms and homes of the stockingers , straying over the parish , formed the village of Bestwood .\nThen , some sixty years ago , a sudden change took place , gin-pits were elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers .\nThe coal and iron field of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was discovered .\nCarston , Waite and Co. appeared .\nAmid tremendous excitement , Lord Palmerston formally opened the company 's first mine at Spinney Park , on the edge of Sherwood Forest .\nAbout this time the notorious Hell Row , which through growing old had acquired an evil reputation , was burned down , and much dirt was cleansed away .\nCarston , Waite & Co. found they had struck on a good thing , so , down the valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall , new mines were sunk , until soon there were six pits working .\nFrom Nuttall , high up on the sandstone among the woods , the railway ran , past the ruined priory of the Carthusians and past Robin Hood 's Well , down to Spinney Park , then on to Minton , a large mine among corn-fields ; from Minton across the farmlands of the valleyside to Bunker 's Hill , branching off there , and running north to Beggarlee and Selby , that looks over at Crich and the hills of Derbyshire : six mines like black studs on the countryside , linked by a loop of fine chain , the railway .\nTo accommodate the regiments of miners , Carston , Waite and Co. built the Squares , great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside of Bestwood , and then , in the brook valley , on the site of Hell Row , they erected the Bottoms .\nThe Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners ' dwellings , two rows of three , like the dots on a blank-six domino , and twelve houses in a block .\nThis double row of dwellings sat at the foot of the rather sharp slope from Bestwood , and looked out , from the attic windows at least , on the slow climb of the valley towards Selby .\nThe houses themselves were substantial and very decent .\nOne could walk all round , seeing little front gardens with auriculas and saxifrage in the shadow of the bottom block , sweet-williams and pinks in the sunny top block ; seeing neat front windows , little porches , little privet hedges , and dormer windows for the attics .\nBut that was outside ; that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours of all the colliers ' wives .\nThe dwelling-room , the kitchen , was at the back of the house , facing inward between the blocks , looking at a scrubby back garden , and then at the ash-pits .\nAnd between the rows , between the long lines of ash-pits , went the alley , where the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked .\nSo , the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms , that was so well built and that looked so nice , were quite unsavoury because people must live in the kitchen , and the kitchens opened on to that nasty alley of ash-pits .\nMrs. Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms , which was already twelve years old and on the downward path , when she descended to it from Bestwood .\nBut it was the best she could do .\nMoreover , she had an end house in one of the top blocks , and thus had only one neighbour ; on the other side an extra strip of garden .\nAnd , having an end house , she enjoyed a kind of aristocracy among the other women of the “ between ” houses , because her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings a week .\nBut this superiority in station was not much consolation to Mrs. Morel .\nShe was thirty-one years old , and had been married eight years .\nA rather small woman , of delicate mould but resolute bearing , she shrank a little from the first contact with the Bottoms women .\nShe came down in the July , and in the September expected her third baby .\nHer husband was a miner .\nThey had only been in their new home three weeks when the wakes , or fair , began .\nMorel , she knew , was sure to make a holiday of it .\nHe went off early on the Monday morning , the day of the fair .\nThe two children were highly excited .\nWilliam , a boy of seven , fled off immediately after breakfast , to prowl round the wakes ground , leaving Annie , who was only five , to whine all morning to go also .\nMrs. Morel did her work .\nShe scarcely knew her neighbours yet , and knew no one with whom to trust the little girl .\nSo she promised to take her to the wakes after dinner .\nWilliam appeared at half-past twelve .\nHe was a very active lad , fair-haired , freckled , with a touch of the Dane or Norwegian about him .\n“ Can I have my dinner , mother ? ”\nhe cried , rushing in with his cap on .\n“ 'Cause it begins at half-past one , the man says so . ”\n“ You can have your dinner as soon as it 's done , ” replied the mother .\n“ Is n't it done ? ”\nhe cried , his blue eyes staring at her in indignation .\n“ Then I 'm goin ' be-out it . ”\n“ You 'll do nothing of the sort .\nIt will be done in five minutes .\nIt is only half-past twelve . ”\n“ They 'll be beginnin ' , ” the boy half cried , half shouted .\n“ You wo n't die if they do , ” said the mother .\n“ Besides , it 's only half-past twelve , so you 've a full hour . ”\nThe lad began hastily to lay the table , and directly the three sat down .\nThey were eating batter-pudding and jam , when the boy jumped off his chair and stood perfectly stiff .\nSome distance away could be heard the first small braying of a merry-go-round , and the tooting of a horn .\nHis face quivered as he looked at his mother .\n“ I told you ! ”\nhe said , running to the dresser for his cap .\n“ Take your pudding in your hand -- and it 's only five past one , so you were wrong -- you have n't got your twopence , ” cried the mother in a breath .\nThe boy came back , bitterly disappointed , for his twopence , then went off without a word .\n“ I want to go , I want to go , ” said Annie , beginning to cry .\n“ Well , and you shall go , whining , wizzening little stick ! ”\nsaid the mother .\nAnd later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill under the tall hedge with her child .\nThe hay was gathered from the fields , and cattle were turned on to the eddish .\nIt was warm , peaceful .\nMrs. Morel did not like the wakes .\nThere were two sets of horses , one going by steam , one pulled round by a pony ; three organs were grinding , and there came odd cracks of pistol-shots , fearful screeching of the cocoanut man 's rattle , shouts of the Aunt Sally man , screeches from the peep-show lady .\nThe mother perceived her son gazing enraptured outside the Lion Wallace booth , at the pictures of this famous lion that had killed a negro and maimed for life two white men .\nShe left him alone , and went to get Annie a spin of toffee .\nPresently the lad stood in front of her , wildly excited .\n“ You never said you was coming -- is n't the ' a lot of things ?\n-- that lion 's killed three men -- I 've spent my tuppence -- an ' look here . ”\nHe pulled from his pocket two egg-cups , with pink moss-roses on them .\n“ I got these from that stall where y' ave ter get them marbles in them holes .\nAn ' I got these two in two goes - ' aepenny a go-they 've got moss-roses on , look here .\nI wanted these . ”\nShe knew he wanted them for her .\n“ H 'm ! ”\nshe said , pleased .\n“ They ARE pretty ! ”\n“ Shall you carry 'em , 'cause I 'm frightened o ' breakin ' 'em ? ”\nHe was tipful of excitement now she had come , led her about the ground , showed her everything .\nThen , at the peep-show , she explained the pictures , in a sort of story , to which he listened as if spellbound .\nHe would not leave her .\nAll the time he stuck close to her , bristling with a small boy 's pride of her .\nFor no other woman looked such a lady as she did , in her little black bonnet and her cloak .\nShe smiled when she saw women she knew .\nWhen she was tired she said to her son : “ Well , are you coming now , or later ? ”\n“ Are you goin ' a ' ready ? ”\nhe cried , his face full of reproach .\n“ Already ?\nIt is past four , I know . ”\n“ What are you goin ' a ' ready for ? ”\nhe lamented .\n“ You need n't come if you do n't want , ” she said .\nAnd she went slowly away with her little girl , whilst her son stood watching her , cut to the heart to let her go , and yet unable to leave the wakes .\nAs she crossed the open ground in front of the Moon and Stars she heard men shouting , and smelled the beer , and hurried a little , thinking her husband was probably in the bar .\nAt about half-past six her son came home , tired now , rather pale , and somewhat wretched .\nHe was miserable , though he did not know it , because he had let her go alone .\nSince she had gone , he had not enjoyed his wakes .\n“ Has my dad been ? ”\nhe asked .\n“ No , ” said the mother .\n",

    "CHAPTER 1 Mrs Gildea had settled early to her morning 's work in what she called the veranda-study of her cottage in Leichardt 's Town .\nIt was a primitive cottage of the old style , standing in a garden and built on the cliff -- the Emu Point side -- overlooking the broad Leichardt River .\nThe veranda , quite twelve feet wide , ran -- Australian fashion -- along the front of the cottage , except for the two closed-in ends forming , one a bathroom and the other a kind of store closet .\nBeing raised a few feet above the ground , the veranda was enclosed by a wooden railing , and this and the supporting posts were twined with creepers that must have been planted at least thirty years .\nOne of these , a stephanotis , showed masses of white bloom , which Joan Gildea casually reflected would have fetched a pretty sum in Covent Garden , and , joining in with a fine-growing asparagus fern , formed an arch over the entrance steps .\nThe end of the veranda , where Mrs Gildea had established herself with her type-writer and paraphernalia of literary work , was screened by a thick-stemmed grape-vine , which made a dapple of shadow and sunshine upon the boarded floor .\nSome bunches of late grapes -- it was the very beginning of March -- hung upon the vine , and , at the other end of the veranda , grew a passion creeper , its great purple fruit looking like huge plums amidst its vivid green leaves .\nThe roof of the veranda was low , with projecting eaves , below which a bunch of yellowing bananas hung to ripen .\nIn fact , the veranda and garden beyond would have been paradise to a fruitarian .\nAgainst the wall of the store-room , stood a large tin dish piled with melons , pine-apples and miscellaneous garden produce , while , between the veranda posts , could be seen a guava-tree , an elderly fig and a loquat all in full bearing .\nThe garden seemed a tangle of all manner of vegetation -- an oleander in bloom , a poinsettia , a yucca , lifting its spike of waxen white blossoms , a narrow flower-border in which the gardenias had become tall shrubs and the scented verbena shrubs almost trees .\nAs for the blend of perfume , it was dreamily intoxicating .\nTwo bamboos , guarding the side entrance gate , made a soft whispering that heightened the dream-sense .\nThe bottom of the garden looked an inchoate mass of greenery topped by the upper boughs of tall straggling gum trees , growing outside where the ground fell gradually to the river .\nFrom where Mrs Gildea sat , she had a view of almost the whole reach of the river where it circles Emu Point .\nFor , as is known to all who know Leichardt 's Town , the river winds in two great loops girdling two low points , so that , in striking a bee-line across the whole town , business and residential , one must cross the river three times .\nMrs Gildea could see the plan of the main street in the Middle Point and the roofs of shops and offices .\nThe busy wharves of the Leichardt 's Land Steam Navigation Company -- familiarly , the L.L.S.N. Co. -- lay opposite on her right , while leftward , across the water , she could trace , as far as the grape-vine would allow , the boundary of the Botanical Gardens and get a sight of the white stone and grey slate end of the big Parliamentary Buildings .\nThe heat-haze over the town and the brilliant sun-sparkles on the river suggested a cruel glare outside the shady veranda and over-grown old garden .\nA pleasant study , if a bit distracting from its plenitude of associations to Australian-born Joan Gildea , who , on her marriage , had been transplanted into English soil , as care-free as a rose cut from the parent stem , and who now , after nearly twenty years , had returned to the scene of her youth -- a widow , a working journalist and shorn of most of her early illusions .\nHer typewriter stood on a bamboo table before her .\nA pile of Australian Hansards for reference sat on a chair at convenient distance .\nA large table with a green cloth , at her elbow , had at one end a tray with the remains of her breakfast of tea , scones and fruit .\nThe end nearest her was littered with sheaves of manuscript , newspaper-cuttings , photographs and sepia sketches -- obviously for purposes of illustration : gum-bottle , stylographs and the rest , with , also , several note-books held open by bananas , recently plucked from the ripening bunch , to serve as paper-weights .\nShe had meant to be very busy that morning .\nThere was her weekly letter for THE IMPERIALIST to send off by to-morrow 's mail , and , moreover , she had to digest the reasons of the eminent journal for returning to her an article that had not met with the editor 's approval -- the great Gibbs : a potent newspaper-factor in the British policy of the day .\nIt had been an immense honour when Mr Gibbs had chosen Joan Gildea from amongst his staff for a roving commission to report upon the political , financial , economic and social aspects of Australia , and upon Imperial interests generally , as represented in various sideshows on her route .\nBut it happened that she was now suffering from a change at the last moment in that route -- a substitution of the commplace P. & O. for the more exciting Canadian Pacific , Mr Gibbs having suddenly decided that Imperialism in Australia demanded his special correspondent 's immediate attention .\nFor this story dates back to the time when Mr Joseph Chamberlain was in office ; when Imperialism , Free Trade and Yellow Labour were the catch words of a party , and before the great Australian Commonwealth had become an historical fact .\nTHE IMPERIALIST 's Special Correspondent looked worried .\nShe was wondering whether the English mail expected to-day would bring her troublesome editorial instructions .\nShe examined some of the photographs and drawings with a dissatisfied air .\nA running inarticulate commentary might have been put into words like this : ' No good ... I can manage the letterpress all right once I get the hang of things .\nBut when it comes to illustrations , I ca n't make even a gum-tree look as if it was growing ... .\nAnd Gibbs hates having amateur snapshots to work up ... .\nHopeless to try for a local artist ... .\nI wonder if Colin McKeith could give me an idea .... .\nWhy to goodness did n't Biddy join me !\n... .\nIf she 'd only had the decency to let me know in time WHY she could n't ... .\nMoney , I suppose -- or a Man !\n... .\nWell , I 'll write and tell her never to expect a literary leg-up from me again ... ' Mrs Gildea pulled the sheet she had been typing out of the machine , inserted another , altered the notch to single spacing and rattled off at top speed till the page was covered .\nThe she appended her signature and wrote this address : To the Lady Bridget O'Hara , Care of Eliza Countess of Gaverick , Upper Brook Street , London , W. on an envelope , into which she slipped her letter -- a letter never to be sent .\nA snap of the gate between the bamboos added a metallic note to the tree 's reedy whimperings , and the postman tramped along the short garden path and up the veranda steps .\n' Morning , Mrs Gildea ... a heavy mail for you ! '\nHe planked down the usual editorial packet -- two or three rolls of proofs , a collection of newspapers , a bulky parcel of private correspondence sent on by the porter of Mrs Gildea 's London flat , some local letters and , finally , two square envelopes , with the remark , as he turned away on his round .\n' My word !\nMrs Gildea , those letters seem to have done a bit of globe-trotting on their own , do n't they ! '\nFor the envelopes were covered with directions , some in Japanese and Chinese hieroglyphics , some in official red ink from various postoffices , a few with the distinctive markings of British Legations and Government Houses where the Special Correspondent should have stayed , but did not -- Only her own name showing through the obliterations , and a final re-addressing by the Bank of Leichardt 's Land .\nMrs Gildea recognised the impulsive , untidy but characteristic handwriting of Lady Bridget O'Hara .\n' From Biddy at last ! '\nshe exclaimed , tore the flap of number one letter , paused and laid it aside .\n' Business first . '\nSo she went carefully through the editorial communication .\nMr Gibbs was not quite so tiresome as she had feared he would be .\nAfter him , the packet from her London flat was inspected and its contents laid aside for future perusal .\nNext , she tackled the local letters .\nOne was embossed with the Bank of Leichardt 's Land stamp and contained a cablegram originally despatched from Rome , which had been received at Vancouver and , thence , had pursued her -- first along the route originally designed , afterwards , with zigzagging , retrogression and much delay , along the one she had taken .\nThat it had reached her at all , said a good deal for Mrs Gildea 's fame as a freely paragraphed newspaper correspondent .\nThe telegram was phrased thus : SORRY IMPOSSIBLE NO FUNDS OTHER REASONS WRITING BIDDY Mrs Gildea 's illuminative ' H 'm ! '\nimplied that her two inductions had been correct .\nNo funds -- and other reasons -- meaning -- a MAN .\nShe scented instantly another of Biddy 's tempestuous love-affairs .\nHad it been merely a question of lack of money with inclination goading , she felt pretty certain that Lady Bridget would have contrived to beg , borrow or steal -- on a hazardous promissory note , after the happy-go-lucky financial morals of that section of society to which by birth she belonged .\nOr , failing these means , that she would have threatened some mad enterprise and so have frightened her aunt Eliza Countess of Gaverick into writing a cheque for three figures .\nOf course , less would have been of no account .\nMrs Gildea opened the two envelopes and sorted the pages in order of their dates .\nThe first had the address of a house in South Belgravia , where lived Sir Luke Tallant of the Colonial Office and Rosamond his wife -- distant connections of the Gavericks .\nLady Bridget 's letters were type-written , most carelessly , with the mistakes corrected down the margin of the flimsy sheets in the manner of author 's proof -- the whole appearance of them suggesting literary ' copy ' .\nLikewise , the slapdash epistolary style of the MS. , which had a certain vividness of its own .\nCHAPTER 2 ' Dearest Joan , You 'll have got my wire .\nVancouver was right , I suppose .\nI sent it from Rome .\nSince then I have been at Montreux with Chris and Molly , and since I came back to England with them , I 've been in too chaotic a state of mind to write letters .\nReally , Chris and Molly 's atmosphere of struggling to keep in the swim on next to nothing a year and of eking out a precarious income by visits to second-rate country houses and cadging on their London friends gets on my nerves to such an extent that Luke and Rosamond 's established \" Colonial Office \" sort of respectability is quite refreshing by contrast .\n",

    "I The day broke gray and dull .\nThe clouds hung heavily , and there was a rawness in the air that suggested snow .\nA woman servant came into a room in which a child was sleeping and drew the curtains .\nShe glanced mechanically at the house opposite , a stucco house with a portico , and went to the child 's bed .\n\" Wake up , Philip , \" she said .\nShe pulled down the bed-clothes , took him in her arms , and carried him downstairs .\nHe was only half awake .\n\" Your mother wants you , \" she said .\nShe opened the door of a room on the floor below and took the child over to a bed in which a woman was lying .\nIt was his mother .\nShe stretched out her arms , and the child nestled by her side .\nHe did not ask why he had been awakened .\nThe woman kissed his eyes , and with thin , small hands felt the warm body through his white flannel nightgown .\nShe pressed him closer to herself .\n\" Are you sleepy , darling ? \"\nshe said .\nHer voice was so weak that it seemed to come already from a great distance .\nThe child did not answer , but smiled comfortably .\nHe was very happy in the large , warm bed , with those soft arms about him .\nHe tried to make himself smaller still as he cuddled up against his mother , and he kissed her sleepily .\nIn a moment he closed his eyes and was fast asleep .\nThe doctor came forwards and stood by the bed-side .\n\" Oh , do n't take him away yet , \" she moaned .\nThe doctor , without answering , looked at her gravely .\nKnowing she would not be allowed to keep the child much longer , the woman kissed him again ; and she passed her hand down his body till she came to his feet ; she held the right foot in her hand and felt the five small toes ; and then slowly passed her hand over the left one .\nShe gave a sob .\n\" What 's the matter ? \"\nsaid the doctor .\n\" You 're tired . \"\nShe shook her head , unable to speak , and the tears rolled down her cheeks .\nThe doctor bent down .\n\" Let me take him . \"\nShe was too weak to resist his wish , and she gave the child up .\nThe doctor handed him back to his nurse .\n\" You 'd better put him back in his own bed . \"\n\" Very well , sir . \"\nThe little boy , still sleeping , was taken away .\nHis mother sobbed now broken-heartedly .\n\" What will happen to him , poor child ? \"\nThe monthly nurse tried to quiet her , and presently , from exhaustion , the crying ceased .\nThe doctor walked to a table on the other side of the room , upon which , under a towel , lay the body of a still-born child .\nHe lifted the towel and looked .\nHe was hidden from the bed by a screen , but the woman guessed what he was doing .\n\" Was it a girl or a boy ? \"\nshe whispered to the nurse .\n\" Another boy . \"\nThe woman did not answer .\nIn a moment the child 's nurse came back .\nShe approached the bed .\n\" Master Philip never woke up , \" she said .\nThere was a pause .\nThen the doctor felt his patient 's pulse once more .\n\" I do n't think there 's anything I can do just now , \" he said .\n\" I 'll call again after breakfast . \"\n\" I 'll show you out , sir , \" said the child 's nurse .\nThey walked downstairs in silence .\nIn the hall the doctor stopped .\n\" You 've sent for Mrs. Carey 's brother-in-law , have n't you ? \"\n\" Yes , sir . \"\n\" D'you know at what time he 'll be here ? \"\n\" No , sir , I 'm expecting a telegram . \"\n\" What about the little boy ?\nI should think he 'd be better out of the way . \"\n\" Miss Watkin said she 'd take him , sir . \"\n\" Who 's she ? \"\n\" She 's his godmother , sir .\nD'you think Mrs. Carey will get over it , sir ? \"\nThe doctor shook his head .\nII It was a week later .\nPhilip was sitting on the floor in the drawing-room at Miss Watkin 's house in Onslow gardens .\nHe was an only child and used to amusing himself .\nThe room was filled with massive furniture , and on each of the sofas were three big cushions .\nThere was a cushion too in each arm-chair .\nAll these he had taken and , with the help of the gilt rout chairs , light and easy to move , had made an elaborate cave in which he could hide himself from the Red Indians who were lurking behind the curtains .\nHe put his ear to the floor and listened to the herd of buffaloes that raced across the prairie .\nPresently , hearing the door open , he held his breath so that he might not be discovered ; but a violent hand pulled away a chair and the cushions fell down .\n\" You naughty boy , Miss Watkin WILL be cross with you . \"\n\" Hulloa , Emma ! \"\nhe said .\nThe nurse bent down and kissed him , then began to shake out the cushions , and put them back in their places .\n\" Am I to come home ? \"\nhe asked .\n\" Yes , I 've come to fetch you . \"\n\" You 've got a new dress on . \"\nIt was in eighteen-eighty-five , and she wore a bustle .\nHer gown was of black velvet , with tight sleeves and sloping shoulders , and the skirt had three large flounces .\nShe wore a black bonnet with velvet strings .\nShe hesitated .\nThe question she had expected did not come , and so she could not give the answer she had prepared .\n\" Are n't you going to ask how your mamma is ? \"\nshe said at length .\n\" Oh , I forgot .\nHow is mamma ? \"\nNow she was ready .\n\" Your mamma is quite well and happy . \"\n\" Oh , I am glad . \"\n\" Your mamma 's gone away .\nYou wo n't ever see her any more . \"\nPhilip did not know what she meant .\n\" Why not ? \"\n\" Your mamma 's in heaven . \"\nShe began to cry , and Philip , though he did not quite understand , cried too .\nEmma was a tall , big-boned woman , with fair hair and large features .\nShe came from Devonshire and , notwithstanding her many years of service in London , had never lost the breadth of her accent .\nHer tears increased her emotion , and she pressed the little boy to her heart .\nShe felt vaguely the pity of that child deprived of the only love in the world that is quite unselfish .\nIt seemed dreadful that he must be handed over to strangers .\nBut in a little while she pulled herself together .\n\" Your Uncle William is waiting in to see you , \" she said .\n\" Go and say good-bye to Miss Watkin , and we 'll go home . \"\n\" I do n't want to say good-bye , \" he answered , instinctively anxious to hide his tears .\n\" Very well , run upstairs and get your hat . \"\nHe fetched it , and when he came down Emma was waiting for him in the hall .\nHe heard the sound of voices in the study behind the dining-room .\nHe paused .\nHe knew that Miss Watkin and her sister were talking to friends , and it seemed to him -- he was nine years old -- that if he went in they would be sorry for him .\n\" I think I 'll go and say good-bye to Miss Watkin . \"\n\" I think you 'd better , \" said Emma .\n\" Go in and tell them I 'm coming , \" he said .\nHe wished to make the most of his opportunity .\nEmma knocked at the door and walked in .\nHe heard her speak .\n\" Master Philip wants to say good-bye to you , miss . \"\nThere was a sudden hush of the conversation , and Philip limped in .\nHenrietta Watkin was a stout woman , with a red face and dyed hair .\nIn those days to dye the hair excited comment , and Philip had heard much gossip at home when his godmother 's changed colour .\nShe lived with an elder sister , who had resigned herself contentedly to old age .\nTwo ladies , whom Philip did not know , were calling , and they looked at him curiously .\n\" My poor child , \" said Miss Watkin , opening her arms .\nShe began to cry .\nPhilip understood now why she had not been in to luncheon and why she wore a black dress .\nShe could not speak .\n\" I 've got to go home , \" said Philip , at last .\nHe disengaged himself from Miss Watkin 's arms , and she kissed him again .\nThen he went to her sister and bade her good-bye too .\nOne of the strange ladies asked if she might kiss him , and he gravely gave her permission .\nThough crying , he keenly enjoyed the sensation he was causing ; he would have been glad to stay a little longer to be made much of , but felt they expected him to go , so he said that Emma was waiting for him .\nHe went out of the room .\nEmma had gone downstairs to speak with a friend in the basement , and he waited for her on the landing .\nHe heard Henrietta Watkin 's voice .\n\" His mother was my greatest friend .\nI ca n't bear to think that she 's dead . \"\n\" You ought n't to have gone to the funeral , Henrietta , \" said her sister .\n\" I knew it would upset you . \"\nThen one of the strangers spoke .\n\" Poor little boy , it 's dreadful to think of him quite alone in the world .\nI see he limps . \"\n\" Yes , he 's got a club-foot .\nIt was such a grief to his mother . \"\nThen Emma came back .\nThey called a hansom , and she told the driver where to go .\nIII When they reached the house Mrs. Carey had died in -- it was in a dreary , respectable street between Notting Hill Gate and High Street , Kensington -- Emma led Philip into the drawing-room .\nHis uncle was writing letters of thanks for the wreaths which had been sent .\nOne of them , which had arrived too late for the funeral , lay in its cardboard box on the hall-table .\n\" Here 's Master Philip , \" said Emma .\n",

    "PART I .\nThe Wild Land I One January day , thirty years ago , the little town of Hanover , anchored on a windy Nebraska tableland , was trying not to be blown away .\nA mist of fine snowflakes was curling and eddying about the cluster of low drab buildings huddled on the gray prairie , under a gray sky .\nThe dwelling-houses were set about haphazard on the tough prairie sod ; some of them looked as if they had been moved in overnight , and others as if they were straying off by themselves , headed straight for the open plain .\nNone of them had any appearance of permanence , and the howling wind blew under them as well as over them .\nThe main street was a deeply rutted road , now frozen hard , which ran from the squat red railway station and the grain “ elevator ” at the north end of the town to the lumber yard and the horse pond at the south end .\nOn either side of this road straggled two uneven rows of wooden buildings ; the general merchandise stores , the two banks , the drug store , the feed store , the saloon , the post-office .\nThe board sidewalks were gray with trampled snow , but at two o'clock in the afternoon the shopkeepers , having come back from dinner , were keeping well behind their frosty windows .\nThe children were all in school , and there was nobody abroad in the streets but a few rough-looking countrymen in coarse overcoats , with their long caps pulled down to their noses .\nSome of them had brought their wives to town , and now and then a red or a plaid shawl flashed out of one store into the shelter of another .\nAt the hitch-bars along the street a few heavy work-horses , harnessed to farm wagons , shivered under their blankets .\nAbout the station everything was quiet , for there would not be another train in until night .\nOn the sidewalk in front of one of the stores sat a little Swede boy , crying bitterly .\nHe was about five years old .\nHis black cloth coat was much too big for him and made him look like a little old man .\nHis shrunken brown flannel dress had been washed many times and left a long stretch of stocking between the hem of his skirt and the tops of his clumsy , copper-toed shoes .\nHis cap was pulled down over his ears ; his nose and his chubby cheeks were chapped and red with cold .\nHe cried quietly , and the few people who hurried by did not notice him .\nHe was afraid to stop any one , afraid to go into the store and ask for help , so he sat wringing his long sleeves and looking up a telegraph pole beside him , whimpering , “ My kitten , oh , my kitten !\nHer will fweeze ! ”\nAt the top of the pole crouched a shivering gray kitten , mewing faintly and clinging desperately to the wood with her claws .\nThe boy had been left at the store while his sister went to the doctor 's office , and in her absence a dog had chased his kitten up the pole .\nThe little creature had never been so high before , and she was too frightened to move .\nHer master was sunk in despair .\nHe was a little country boy , and this village was to him a very strange and perplexing place , where people wore fine clothes and had hard hearts .\nHe always felt shy and awkward here , and wanted to hide behind things for fear some one might laugh at him .\nJust now , he was too unhappy to care who laughed .\nAt last he seemed to see a ray of hope : his sister was coming , and he got up and ran toward her in his heavy shoes .\nHis sister was a tall , strong girl , and she walked rapidly and resolutely , as if she knew exactly where she was going and what she was going to do next .\nShe wore a man 's long ulster ( not as if it were an affliction , but as if it were very comfortable and belonged to her ; carried it like a young soldier ) , and a round plush cap , tied down with a thick veil .\nShe had a serious , thoughtful face , and her clear , deep blue eyes were fixed intently on the distance , without seeming to see anything , as if she were in trouble .\nShe did not notice the little boy until he pulled her by the coat .\nThen she stopped short and stooped down to wipe his wet face .\n“ Why , Emil !\nI told you to stay in the store and not to come out .\nWhat is the matter with you ? ”\n“ My kitten , sister , my kitten !\nA man put her out , and a dog chased her up there . ”\nHis forefinger , projecting from the sleeve of his coat , pointed up to the wretched little creature on the pole .\n“ Oh , Emil !\nDid n't I tell you she 'd get us into trouble of some kind , if you brought her ?\nWhat made you tease me so ?\nBut there , I ought to have known better myself . ”\nShe went to the foot of the pole and held out her arms , crying , “ Kitty , kitty , kitty , ” but the kitten only mewed and faintly waved its tail .\nAlexandra turned away decidedly .\n“ No , she wo n't come down .\nSomebody will have to go up after her .\nI saw the Linstrums ' wagon in town .\nI 'll go and see if I can find Carl .\nMaybe he can do something .\nOnly you must stop crying , or I wo n't go a step .\nWhere 's your comforter ?\nDid you leave it in the store ?\nNever mind .\nHold still , till I put this on you . ”\nShe unwound the brown veil from her head and tied it about his throat .\nA shabby little traveling man , who was just then coming out of the store on his way to the saloon , stopped and gazed stupidly at the shining mass of hair she bared when she took off her veil ; two thick braids , pinned about her head in the German way , with a fringe of reddish-yellow curls blowing out from under her cap .\nHe took his cigar out of his mouth and held the wet end between the fingers of his woolen glove .\n“ My God , girl , what a head of hair ! ” he exclaimed , quite innocently and foolishly .\nShe stabbed him with a glance of Amazonian fierceness and drew in her lower lip -- most unnecessary severity .\nIt gave the little clothing drummer such a start that he actually let his cigar fall to the sidewalk and went off weakly in the teeth of the wind to the saloon .\nHis hand was still unsteady when he took his glass from the bartender .\nHis feeble flirtatious instincts had been crushed before , but never so mercilessly .\nHe felt cheap and ill-used , as if some one had taken advantage of him .\nWhen a drummer had been knocking about in little drab towns and crawling across the wintry country in dirty smoking-cars , was he to be blamed if , when he chanced upon a fine human creature , he suddenly wished himself more of a man ?\nWhile the little drummer was drinking to recover his nerve , Alexandra hurried to the drug store as the most likely place to find Carl Linstrum .\nThere he was , turning over a portfolio of chromo “ studies ” which the druggist sold to the Hanover women who did china-painting .\nAlexandra explained her predicament , and the boy followed her to the corner , where Emil still sat by the pole .\n“ I 'll have to go up after her , Alexandra .\nI think at the depot they have some spikes I can strap on my feet .\nWait a minute . ”\nCarl thrust his hands into his pockets , lowered his head , and darted up the street against the north wind .\nHe was a tall boy of fifteen , slight and narrow-chested .\nWhen he came back with the spikes , Alexandra asked him what he had done with his overcoat .\n“ I left it in the drug store .\nI could n't climb in it , anyhow .\nCatch me if I fall , Emil , ” he called back as he began his ascent .\nAlexandra watched him anxiously ; the cold was bitter enough on the ground .\nThe kitten would not budge an inch .\nCarl had to go to the very top of the pole , and then had some difficulty in tearing her from her hold .\nWhen he reached the ground , he handed the cat to her tearful little master .\n“ Now go into the store with her , Emil , and get warm . ”\nHe opened the door for the child .\n“ Wait a minute , Alexandra .\nWhy ca n't I drive for you as far as our place ?\nIt 's getting colder every minute .\nHave you seen the doctor ? ”\n“ Yes .\nHe is coming over to-morrow .\nBut he says father ca n't get better ; ca n't get well . ”\nThe girl 's lip trembled .\nShe looked fixedly up the bleak street as if she were gathering her strength to face something , as if she were trying with all her might to grasp a situation which , no matter how painful , must be met and dealt with somehow .\nThe wind flapped the skirts of her heavy coat about her .\nCarl did not say anything , but she felt his sympathy .\nHe , too , was lonely .\nHe was a thin , frail boy , with brooding dark eyes , very quiet in all his movements .\nThere was a delicate pallor in his thin face , and his mouth was too sensitive for a boy 's .\nThe lips had already a little curl of bitterness and skepticism .\nThe two friends stood for a few moments on the windy street corner , not speaking a word , as two travelers , who have lost their way , sometimes stand and admit their perplexity in silence .\nWhen Carl turned away he said , “ I 'll see to your team . ”\nAlexandra went into the store to have her purchases packed in the egg-boxes , and to get warm before she set out on her long cold drive .\nWhen she looked for Emil , she found him sitting on a step of the staircase that led up to the clothing and carpet department .\nHe was playing with a little Bohemian girl , Marie Tovesky , who was tying her handkerchief over the kitten 's head for a bonnet .\nMarie was a stranger in the country , having come from Omaha with her mother to visit her uncle , Joe Tovesky .\nShe was a dark child , with brown curly hair , like a brunette doll 's , a coaxing little red mouth , and round , yellow-brown eyes .\nEvery one noticed her eyes ; the brown iris had golden glints that made them look like gold-stone , or , in softer lights , like that Colorado mineral called tiger-eye .\n",

    "CHAPTER I Mr Verloc , going out in the morning , left his shop nominally in charge of his brother-in-law .\nIt could be done , because there was very little business at any time , and practically none at all before the evening .\nMr Verloc cared but little about his ostensible business .\nAnd , moreover , his wife was in charge of his brother-in-law .\nThe shop was small , and so was the house .\nIt was one of those grimy brick houses which existed in large quantities before the era of reconstruction dawned upon London .\nThe shop was a square box of a place , with the front glazed in small panes .\nIn the daytime the door remained closed ; in the evening it stood discreetly but suspiciously ajar .\nThe window contained photographs of more or less undressed dancing girls ; nondescript packages in wrappers like patent medicines ; closed yellow paper envelopes , very flimsy , and marked two-and-six in heavy black figures ; a few numbers of ancient French comic publications hung across a string as if to dry ; a dingy blue china bowl , a casket of black wood , bottles of marking ink , and rubber stamps ; a few books , with titles hinting at impropriety ; a few apparently old copies of obscure newspapers , badly printed , with titles like _ The Torch _ , _ The Gong _ — rousing titles .\nAnd the two gas jets inside the panes were always turned low , either for economy ’s sake or for the sake of the customers .\nThese customers were either very young men , who hung about the window for a time before slipping in suddenly ; or men of a more mature age , but looking generally as if they were not in funds .\nSome of that last kind had the collars of their overcoats turned right up to their moustaches , and traces of mud on the bottom of their nether garments , which had the appearance of being much worn and not very valuable .\nAnd the legs inside them did not , as a general rule , seem of much account either .\nWith their hands plunged deep in the side pockets of their coats , they dodged in sideways , one shoulder first , as if afraid to start the bell going .\nThe bell , hung on the door by means of a curved ribbon of steel , was difficult to circumvent .\nIt was hopelessly cracked ; but of an evening , at the slightest provocation , it clattered behind the customer with impudent virulence .\nIt clattered ; and at that signal , through the dusty glass door behind the painted deal counter , Mr Verloc would issue hastily from the parlour at the back .\nHis eyes were naturally heavy ; he had an air of having wallowed , fully dressed , all day on an unmade bed .\nAnother man would have felt such an appearance a distinct disadvantage .\nIn a commercial transaction of the retail order much depends on the seller ’s engaging and amiable aspect .\nBut Mr Verloc knew his business , and remained undisturbed by any sort of æsthetic doubt about his appearance .\nWith a firm , steady-eyed impudence , which seemed to hold back the threat of some abominable menace , he would proceed to sell over the counter some object looking obviously and scandalously not worth the money which passed in the transaction : a small cardboard box with apparently nothing inside , for instance , or one of those carefully closed yellow flimsy envelopes , or a soiled volume in paper covers with a promising title .\nNow and then it happened that one of the faded , yellow dancing girls would get sold to an amateur , as though she had been alive and young .\nSometimes it was Mrs Verloc who would appear at the call of the cracked bell .\nWinnie Verloc was a young woman with a full bust , in a tight bodice , and with broad hips .\nHer hair was very tidy .\nSteady-eyed like her husband , she preserved an air of unfathomable indifference behind the rampart of the counter .\nThen the customer of comparatively tender years would get suddenly disconcerted at having to deal with a woman , and with rage in his heart would proffer a request for a bottle of marking ink , retail value sixpence ( price in Verloc ’s shop one-and-sixpence ) , which , once outside , he would drop stealthily into the gutter .\nThe evening visitors — the men with collars turned up and soft hats rammed down — nodded familiarly to Mrs Verloc , and with a muttered greeting , lifted up the flap at the end of the counter in order to pass into the back parlour , which gave access to a passage and to a steep flight of stairs .\nThe door of the shop was the only means of entrance to the house in which Mr Verloc carried on his business of a seller of shady wares , exercised his vocation of a protector of society , and cultivated his domestic virtues .\nThese last were pronounced .\nHe was thoroughly domesticated .\nNeither his spiritual , nor his mental , nor his physical needs were of the kind to take him much abroad .\nHe found at home the ease of his body and the peace of his conscience , together with Mrs Verloc ’s wifely attentions and Mrs Verloc ’s mother ’s deferential regard .\nWinnie ’s mother was a stout , wheezy woman , with a large brown face .\nShe wore a black wig under a white cap .\nHer swollen legs rendered her inactive .\nShe considered herself to be of French descent , which might have been true ; and after a good many years of married life with a licensed victualler of the more common sort , she provided for the years of widowhood by letting furnished apartments for gentlemen near Vauxhall Bridge Road in a square once of some splendour and still included in the district of Belgravia .\nThis topographical fact was of some advantage in advertising her rooms ; but the patrons of the worthy widow were not exactly of the fashionable kind .\nSuch as they were , her daughter Winnie helped to look after them .\nTraces of the French descent which the widow boasted of were apparent in Winnie too .\nThey were apparent in the extremely neat and artistic arrangement of her glossy dark hair .\nWinnie had also other charms : her youth ; her full , rounded form ; her clear complexion ; the provocation of her unfathomable reserve , which never went so far as to prevent conversation , carried on on the lodgers ’ part with animation , and on hers with an equable amiability .\nIt must be that Mr Verloc was susceptible to these fascinations .\nMr Verloc was an intermittent patron .\nHe came and went without any very apparent reason .\nHe generally arrived in London ( like the influenza ) from the Continent , only he arrived unheralded by the Press ; and his visitations set in with great severity .\nHe breakfasted in bed , and remained wallowing there with an air of quiet enjoyment till noon every day — and sometimes even to a later hour .\nBut when he went out he seemed to experience a great difficulty in finding his way back to his temporary home in the Belgravian square .\nHe left it late , and returned to it early — as early as three or four in the morning ; and on waking up at ten addressed Winnie , bringing in the breakfast tray , with jocular , exhausted civility , in the hoarse , failing tones of a man who had been talking vehemently for many hours together .\nHis prominent , heavy-lidded eyes rolled sideways amorously and languidly , the bedclothes were pulled up to his chin , and his dark smooth moustache covered his thick lips capable of much honeyed banter .\nIn Winnie ’s mother ’s opinion Mr Verloc was a very nice gentleman .\nFrom her life ’s experience gathered in various “ business houses ” the good woman had taken into her retirement an ideal of gentlemanliness as exhibited by the patrons of private-saloon bars .\nMr Verloc approached that ideal ; he attained it , in fact .\n“ Of course , we ’ll take over your furniture , mother , ” Winnie had remarked .\nThe lodging-house was to be given up .\nIt seems it would not answer to carry it on .\nIt would have been too much trouble for Mr Verloc .\nIt would not have been convenient for his other business .\nWhat his business was he did not say ; but after his engagement to Winnie he took the trouble to get up before noon , and descending the basement stairs , make himself pleasant to Winnie ’s mother in the breakfast-room downstairs where she had her motionless being .\nHe stroked the cat , poked the fire , had his lunch served to him there .\nHe left its slightly stuffy cosiness with evident reluctance , but , all the same , remained out till the night was far advanced .\nHe never offered to take Winnie to theatres , as such a nice gentleman ought to have done .\nHis evenings were occupied .\nHis work was in a way political , he told Winnie once .\nShe would have , he warned her , to be very nice to his political friends .\nAnd with her straight , unfathomable glance she answered that she would be so , of course .\nHow much more he told her as to his occupation it was impossible for Winnie ’s mother to discover .\nThe married couple took her over with the furniture .\nThe mean aspect of the shop surprised her .\nThe change from the Belgravian square to the narrow street in Soho affected her legs adversely .\nThey became of an enormous size .\nOn the other hand , she experienced a complete relief from material cares .\nHer son-in-law ’s heavy good nature inspired her with a sense of absolute safety .\nHer daughter ’s future was obviously assured , and even as to her son Stevie she need have no anxiety .\nShe had not been able to conceal from herself that he was a terrible encumbrance , that poor Stevie .\nBut in view of Winnie ’s fondness for her delicate brother , and of Mr Verloc ’s kind and generous disposition , she felt that the poor boy was pretty safe in this rough world .\nAnd in her heart of hearts she was not perhaps displeased that the Verlocs had no children .\nAs that circumstance seemed perfectly indifferent to Mr Verloc , and as Winnie found an object of quasi-maternal affection in her brother , perhaps this was just as well for poor Stevie .\nFor he was difficult to dispose of , that boy .\nHe was delicate and , in a frail way , good-looking too , except for the vacant droop of his lower lip .\nUnder our excellent system of compulsory education he had learned to read and write , notwithstanding the unfavourable aspect of the lower lip .\nBut as errand-boy he did not turn out a great success .\nHe forgot his messages ; he was easily diverted from the straight path of duty by the attractions of stray cats and dogs , which he followed down narrow alleys into unsavoury courts ; by the comedies of the streets , which he contemplated open-mouthed , to the detriment of his employer ’s interests ; or by the dramas of fallen horses , whose pathos and violence induced him sometimes to shriek pierceingly in a crowd , which disliked to be disturbed by sounds of distress in its quiet enjoyment of the national spectacle .\nWhen led away by a grave and protecting policeman , it would often become apparent that poor Stevie had forgotten his address — at least for a time .\nA brusque question caused him to stutter to the point of suffocation .\nWhen startled by anything perplexing he used to squint horribly .\nHowever , he never had any fits ( which was encouraging ) ; and before the natural outbursts of impatience on the part of his father he could always , in his childhood ’s days , run for protection behind the short skirts of his sister Winnie .\nOn the other hand , he might have been suspected of hiding a fund of reckless naughtiness .\nWhen he had reached the age of fourteen a friend of his late father , an agent for a foreign preserved milk firm , having given him an opening as office-boy , he was discovered one foggy afternoon , in his chief ’s absence , busy letting off fireworks on the staircase .\nHe touched off in quick succession a set of fierce rockets , angry catherine wheels , loudly exploding squibs — and the matter might have turned out very serious .\nAn awful panic spread through the whole building .\nWild-eyed , choking clerks stampeded through the passages full of smoke , silk hats and elderly business men could be seen rolling independently down the stairs .\nStevie did not seem to derive any personal gratification from what he had done .\nHis motives for this stroke of originality were difficult to discover .\nIt was only later on that Winnie obtained from him a misty and confused confession .\nIt seems that two other office-boys in the building had worked upon his feelings by tales of injustice and oppression till they had wrought his compassion to the pitch of that frenzy .\nBut his father ’s friend , of course , dismissed him summarily as likely to ruin his business .\nAfter that altruistic exploit Stevie was put to help wash the dishes in the basement kitchen , and to black the boots of the gentlemen patronising the Belgravian mansion .\nThere was obviously no future in such work .\nThe gentlemen tipped him a shilling now and then .\nMr Verloc showed himself the most generous of lodgers .\nBut altogether all that did not amount to much either in the way of gain or prospects ; so that when Winnie announced her engagement to Mr Verloc her mother could not help wondering , with a sigh and a glance towards the scullery , what would become of poor Stephen now .\n",

    "Chapter I .\nTHE MAGNET ATTRACTING -- A WAIF AMID FORCES When Caroline Meeber boarded the afternoon train for Chicago , her total outfit consisted of a small trunk , a cheap imitation alligator-skin satchel , a small lunch in a paper box , and a yellow leather snap purse , containing her ticket , a scrap of paper with her sister 's address in Van Buren Street , and four dollars in money .\nIt was in August , 1889 .\nShe was eighteen years of age , bright , timid , and full of the illusions of ignorance and youth .\nWhatever touch of regret at parting characterised her thoughts , it was certainly not for advantages now being given up .\nA gush of tears at her mother 's farewell kiss , a touch in her throat when the cars clacked by the flour mill where her father worked by the day , a pathetic sigh as the familiar green environs of the village passed in review , and the threads which bound her so lightly to girlhood and home were irretrievably broken .\nTo be sure there was always the next station , where one might descend and return .\nThere was the great city , bound more closely by these very trains which came up daily .\nColumbia City was not so very far away , even once she was in Chicago .\nWhat , pray , is a few hours -- a few hundred miles ?\nShe looked at the little slip bearing her sister 's address and wondered .\nShe gazed at the green landscape , now passing in swift review , until her swifter thoughts replaced its impression with vague conjectures of what Chicago might be .\nWhen a girl leaves her home at eighteen , she does one of two things .\nEither she falls into saving hands and becomes better , or she rapidly assumes the cosmopolitan standard of virtue and becomes worse .\nOf an intermediate balance , under the circumstances , there is no possibility .\nThe city has its cunning wiles , no less than the infinitely smaller and more human tempter .\nThere are large forces which allure with all the soulfulness of expression possible in the most cultured human .\nThe gleam of a thousand lights is often as effective as the persuasive light in a wooing and fascinating eye .\nHalf the undoing of the unsophisticated and natural mind is accomplished by forces wholly superhuman .\nA blare of sound , a roar of life , a vast array of human hives , appeal to the astonished senses in equivocal terms .\nWithout a counsellor at hand to whisper cautious interpretations , what falsehoods may not these things breathe into the unguarded ear !\nUnrecognised for what they are , their beauty , like music , too often relaxes , then weakens , then perverts the simpler human perceptions .\nCaroline , or Sister Carrie , as she had been half affectionately termed by the family , was possessed of a mind rudimentary in its power of observation and analysis .\nSelf-interest with her was high , but not strong .\nIt was , nevertheless , her guiding characteristic .\nWarm with the fancies of youth , pretty with the insipid prettiness of the formative period , possessed of a figure promising eventual shapeliness and an eye alight with certain native intelligence , she was a fair example of the middle American class -- two generations removed from the emigrant .\nBooks were beyond her interest -- knowledge a sealed book .\nIn the intuitive graces she was still crude .\nShe could scarcely toss her head gracefully .\nHer hands were almost ineffectual .\nThe feet , though small , were set flatly .\nAnd yet she was interested in her charms , quick to understand the keener pleasures of life , ambitious to gain in material things .\nA half-equipped little knight she was , venturing to reconnoitre the mysterious city and dreaming wild dreams of some vague , far-off supremacy , which should make it prey and subject -- the proper penitent , grovelling at a woman 's slipper .\n“ That , ” said a voice in her ear , “ is one of the prettiest little resorts in Wisconsin . ”\n“ Is it ? ”\nshe answered nervously .\nThe train was just pulling out of Waukesha .\nFor some time she had been conscious of a man behind .\nShe felt him observing her mass of hair .\nHe had been fidgetting , and with natural intuition she felt a certain interest growing in that quarter .\nHer maidenly reserve , and a certain sense of what was conventional under the circumstances , called her to forestall and deny this familiarity , but the daring and magnetism of the individual , born of past experiences and triumphs , prevailed .\nShe answered .\nHe leaned forward to put his elbows upon the back of her seat and proceeded to make himself volubly agreeable .\n“ Yes , that is a great resort for Chicago people .\nThe hotels are swell .\nYou are not familiar with this part of the country , are you ? ”\n“ Oh , yes , I am , ” answered Carrie .\n“ That is , I live at Columbia City .\nI have never been through here , though . ”\n“ And so this is your first visit to Chicago , ” he observed .\nAll the time she was conscious of certain features out of the side of her eye .\nFlush , colourful cheeks , a light moustache , a grey fedora hat .\nShe now turned and looked upon him in full , the instincts of self-protection and coquetry mingling confusedly in her brain .\n“ I did n't say that , ” she said .\n“ Oh , ” he answered , in a very pleasing way and with an assumed air of mistake , “ I thought you did . ”\nHere was a type of the travelling canvasser for a manufacturing house -- a class which at that time was first being dubbed by the slang of the day “ drummers . ”\nHe came within the meaning of a still newer term , which had sprung into general use among Americans in 1880 , and which concisely expressed the thought of one whose dress or manners are calculated to elicit the admiration of susceptible young women -- a “ masher . ”\nHis suit was of a striped and crossed pattern of brown wool , new at that time , but since become familiar as a business suit .\nThe low crotch of the vest revealed a stiff shirt bosom of white and pink stripes .\nFrom his coat sleeves protruded a pair of linen cuffs of the same pattern , fastened with large , gold plate buttons , set with the common yellow agates known as “ cat 's - eyes . ”\nHis fingers bore several rings -- one , the ever-enduring heavy seal -- and from his vest dangled a neat gold watch chain , from which was suspended the secret insignia of the Order of Elks .\nThe whole suit was rather tight-fitting , and was finished off with heavy-soled tan shoes , highly polished , and the grey fedora hat .\nHe was , for the order of intellect represented , attractive , and whatever he had to recommend him , you may be sure was not lost upon Carrie , in this , her first glance .\nLest this order of individual should permanently pass , let me put down some of the most striking characteristics of his most successful manner and method .\nGood clothes , of course , were the first essential , the things without which he was nothing .\nA strong physical nature , actuated by a keen desire for the feminine , was the next .\nA mind free of any consideration of the problems or forces of the world and actuated not by greed , but an insatiable love of variable pleasure .\nHis method was always simple .\nIts principal element was daring , backed , of course , by an intense desire and admiration for the sex .\nLet him meet with a young woman once and he would approach her with an air of kindly familiarity , not unmixed with pleading , which would result in most cases in a tolerant acceptance .\nIf she showed any tendency to coquetry he would be apt to straighten her tie , or if she “ took up ” with him at all , to call her by her first name .\nIf he visited a department store it was to lounge familiarly over the counter and ask some leading questions .\nIn more exclusive circles , on the train or in waiting stations , he went slower .\nIf some seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all attention -- to pass the compliments of the day , to lead the way to the parlor car , carrying her grip , or , failing that , to take a seat next her with the hope of being able to court her to her destination .\nPillows , books , a footstool , the shade lowered ; all these figured in the things which he could do .\nIf , when she reached her destination he did not alight and attend her baggage for her , it was because , in his own estimation , he had signally failed .\nA woman should some day write the complete philosophy of clothes .\nNo matter how young , it is one of the things she wholly comprehends .\nThere is an indescribably faint line in the matter of man 's apparel which somehow divides for her those who are worth glancing at and those who are not .\nOnce an individual has passed this faint line on the way downward he will get no glance from her .\nThere is another line at which the dress of a man will cause her to study her own .\nThis line the individual at her elbow now marked for Carrie .\nShe became conscious of an inequality .\nHer own plain blue dress , with its black cotton tape trimmings , now seemed to her shabby .\nShe felt the worn state of her shoes .\n“ Let 's see , ” he went on , “ I know quite a number of people in your town .\nMorgenroth the clothier and Gibson the dry goods man . ”\n“ Oh , do you ? ”\nshe interrupted , aroused by memories of longings their show windows had cost her .\nAt last he had a clew to her interest , and followed it deftly .\nIn a few minutes he had come about into her seat .\nHe talked of sales of clothing , his travels , Chicago , and the amusements of that city .\n“ If you are going there , you will enjoy it immensely .\nHave you relatives ? ”\n“ I am going to visit my sister , ” she explained .\n“ You want to see Lincoln Park , ” he said , “ and Michigan Boulevard .\nThey are putting up great buildings there .\nIt 's a second New York -- great .\nSo much to see -- theatres , crowds , fine houses -- oh , you 'll like that . ”\nThere was a little ache in her fancy of all he described .\nHer insignificance in the presence of so much magnificence faintly affected her .\nShe realised that hers was not to be a round of pleasure , and yet there was something promising in all the material prospect he set forth .\nThere was something satisfactory in the attention of this individual with his good clothes .\nShe could not help smiling as he told her of some popular actress of whom she reminded him .\nShe was not silly , and yet attention of this sort had its weight .\n",

    "I The Nellie , a cruising yawl , swung to her anchor without a flutter of the sails , and was at rest .\nThe flood had made , the wind was nearly calm , and being bound down the river , the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide .\nThe sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway .\nIn the offing the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint , and in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked , with gleams of varnished sprits .\nA haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing flatness .\nThe air was dark above Gravesend , and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom , brooding motionless over the biggest , and the greatest , town on earth .\nThe Director of Companies was our captain and our host .\nWe four affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward .\nOn the whole river there was nothing that looked half so nautical .\nHe resembled a pilot , which to a seaman is trustworthiness personified .\nIt was difficult to realize his work was not out there in the luminous estuary , but behind him , within the brooding gloom .\nBetween us there was , as I have already said somewhere , the bond of the sea .\nBesides holding our hearts together through long periods of separation , it had the effect of making us tolerant of each other 's yarns -- and even convictions .\nThe Lawyer -- the best of old fellows -- had , because of his many years and many virtues , the only cushion on deck , and was lying on the only rug .\nThe Accountant had brought out already a box of dominoes , and was toying architecturally with the bones .\nMarlow sat cross-legged right aft , leaning against the mizzen-mast .\nHe had sunken cheeks , a yellow complexion , a straight back , an ascetic aspect , and , with his arms dropped , the palms of hands outwards , resembled an idol .\nThe director , satisfied the anchor had good hold , made his way aft and sat down amongst us .\nWe exchanged a few words lazily .\nAfterwards there was silence on board the yacht .\nFor some reason or other we did not begin that game of dominoes .\nWe felt meditative , and fit for nothing but placid staring .\nThe day was ending in a serenity of still and exquisite brilliance .\nThe water shone pacifically ; the sky , without a speck , was a benign immensity of unstained light ; the very mist on the Essex marsh was like a gauzy and radiant fabric , hung from the wooded rises inland , and draping the low shores in diaphanous folds .\nOnly the gloom to the west , brooding over the upper reaches , became more sombre every minute , as if angered by the approach of the sun .\nAnd at last , in its curved and imperceptible fall , the sun sank low , and from glowing white changed to a dull red without rays and without heat , as if about to go out suddenly , stricken to death by the touch of that gloom brooding over a crowd of men .\nForthwith a change came over the waters , and the serenity became less brilliant but more profound .\nThe old river in its broad reach rested unruffled at the decline of day , after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks , spread out in the tranquil dignity of a waterway leading to the uttermost ends of the earth .\nWe looked at the venerable stream not in the vivid flush of a short day that comes and departs for ever , but in the august light of abiding memories .\nAnd indeed nothing is easier for a man who has , as the phrase goes , “ followed the sea ” with reverence and affection , than to evoke the great spirit of the past upon the lower reaches of the Thames .\nThe tidal current runs to and fro in its unceasing service , crowded with memories of men and ships it had borne to the rest of home or to the battles of the sea .\nIt had known and served all the men of whom the nation is proud , from Sir Francis Drake to Sir John Franklin , knights all , titled and untitled -- the great knights-errant of the sea .\nIt had borne all the ships whose names are like jewels flashing in the night of time , from the _ Golden Hind _ returning with her rotund flanks full of treasure , to be visited by the Queen 's Highness and thus pass out of the gigantic tale , to the _ Erebus _ and _ Terror _ , bound on other conquests -- and that never returned .\nIt had known the ships and the men .\nThey had sailed from Deptford , from Greenwich , from Erith -- the adventurers and the settlers ; kings ' ships and the ships of men on ' Change ; captains , admirals , the dark “ interlopers ” of the Eastern trade , and the commissioned “ generals ” of East India fleets .\nHunters for gold or pursuers of fame , they all had gone out on that stream , bearing the sword , and often the torch , messengers of the might within the land , bearers of a spark from the sacred fire .\nWhat greatness had not floated on the ebb of that river into the mystery of an unknown earth !\n... The dreams of men , the seed of commonwealths , the germs of empires .\nThe sun set ; the dusk fell on the stream , and lights began to appear along the shore .\nThe Chapman light-house , a three-legged thing erect on a mud-flat , shone strongly .\nLights of ships moved in the fairway -- a great stir of lights going up and going down .\nAnd farther west on the upper reaches the place of the monstrous town was still marked ominously on the sky , a brooding gloom in sunshine , a lurid glare under the stars .\n“ And this also , ” said Marlow suddenly , “ has been one of the dark places of the earth . ”\nHe was the only man of us who still “ followed the sea . ”\nThe worst that could be said of him was that he did not represent his class .\nHe was a seaman , but he was a wanderer , too , while most seamen lead , if one may so express it , a sedentary life .\nTheir minds are of the stay-at-home order , and their home is always with them -- the ship ; and so is their country -- the sea .\nOne ship is very much like another , and the sea is always the same .\nIn the immutability of their surroundings the foreign shores , the foreign faces , the changing immensity of life , glide past , veiled not by a sense of mystery but by a slightly disdainful ignorance ; for there is nothing mysterious to a seaman unless it be the sea itself , which is the mistress of his existence and as inscrutable as Destiny .\nFor the rest , after his hours of work , a casual stroll or a casual spree on shore suffices to unfold for him the secret of a whole continent , and generally he finds the secret not worth knowing .\nThe yarns of seamen have a direct simplicity , the whole meaning of which lies within the shell of a cracked nut .\nBut Marlow was not typical ( if his propensity to spin yarns be excepted ) , and to him the meaning of an episode was not inside like a kernel but outside , enveloping the tale which brought it out only as a glow brings out a haze , in the likeness of one of these misty halos that sometimes are made visible by the spectral illumination of moonshine .\nHis remark did not seem at all surprising .\nIt was just like Marlow .\nIt was accepted in silence .\nNo one took the trouble to grunt even ; and presently he said , very slow -- “ I was thinking of very old times , when the Romans first came here , nineteen hundred years ago -- the other day ... .\nLight came out of this river since -- you say Knights ?\nYes ; but it is like a running blaze on a plain , like a flash of lightning in the clouds .\nWe live in the flicker -- may it last as long as the old earth keeps rolling !\nBut darkness was here yesterday .\nImagine the feelings of a commander of a fine -- what d'ye call 'em ?\n-- trireme in the Mediterranean , ordered suddenly to the north ; run overland across the Gauls in a hurry ; put in charge of one of these craft the legionaries -- a wonderful lot of handy men they must have been , too -- used to build , apparently by the hundred , in a month or two , if we may believe what we read .\nImagine him here -- the very end of the world , a sea the colour of lead , a sky the colour of smoke , a kind of ship about as rigid as a concertina -- and going up this river with stores , or orders , or what you like .\nSand-banks , marshes , forests , savages , -- precious little to eat fit for a civilized man , nothing but Thames water to drink .\nNo Falernian wine here , no going ashore .\nHere and there a military camp lost in a wilderness , like a needle in a bundle of hay -- cold , fog , tempests , disease , exile , and death -- death skulking in the air , in the water , in the bush .\nThey must have been dying like flies here .\nOh , yes -- he did it .\nDid it very well , too , no doubt , and without thinking much about it either , except afterwards to brag of what he had gone through in his time , perhaps .\nThey were men enough to face the darkness .\nAnd perhaps he was cheered by keeping his eye on a chance of promotion to the fleet at Ravenna by and by , if he had good friends in Rome and survived the awful climate .\nOr think of a decent young citizen in a toga -- perhaps too much dice , you know -- coming out here in the train of some prefect , or tax-gatherer , or trader even , to mend his fortunes .\nLand in a swamp , march through the woods , and in some inland post feel the savagery , the utter savagery , had closed round him -- all that mysterious life of the wilderness that stirs in the forest , in the jungles , in the hearts of wild men .\nThere 's no initiation either into such mysteries .\nHe has to live in the midst of the incomprehensible , which is also detestable .\nAnd it has a fascination , too , that goes to work upon him .\nThe fascination of the abomination -- you know , imagine the growing regrets , the longing to escape , the powerless disgust , the surrender , the hate . ”\n",

    "Chapter 1 Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo ... His father told him that story : his father looked at him through a glass : he had a hairy face .\nHe was baby tuckoo .\nThe moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived : she sold lemon platt .\nO , the wild rose blossoms On the little green place .\nHe sang that song .\nThat was his song .\nO , the green wothe botheth .\nWhen you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold .\nHis mother put on the oilsheet .\nThat had the queer smell .\nHis mother had a nicer smell than his father .\nShe played on the piano the sailor 's hornpipe for him to dance .\nHe danced : Tralala lala , Tralala tralaladdy , Tralala lala , Tralala lala .\nUncle Charles and Dante clapped .\nThey were older than his father and mother but uncle Charles was older than Dante .\nDante had two brushes in her press .\nThe brush with the maroon velvet back was for Michael Davitt and the brush with the green velvet back was for Parnell .\nDante gave him a cachou every time he brought her a piece of tissue paper .\nThe Vances lived in number seven .\nThey had a different father and mother .\nThey were Eileen 's father and mother .\nWhen they were grown up he was going to marry Eileen .\nHe hid under the table .\nHis mother said : -- O , Stephen will apologize .\nDante said : -- O , if not , the eagles will come and pull out his eyes .\n-- Pull out his eyes , Apologize , Apologize , Pull out his eyes .\nApologize , Pull out his eyes , Pull out his eyes , Apologize .\n* * * * * The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys .\nAll were shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries .\nThe evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey light .\nHe kept on the fringe of his line , out of sight of his prefect , out of the reach of the rude feet , feigning to run now and then .\nHe felt his body small and weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak and watery .\nRody Kickham was not like that : he would be captain of the third line all the fellows said .\nRody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche was a stink .\nRody Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper in the refectory .\nNasty Roche had big hands .\nHe called the Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket .\nAnd one day he had asked : -- What is your name ?\nStephen had answered : Stephen Dedalus .\nThen Nasty Roche had said : -- What kind of a name is that ?\nAnd when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty Roche had asked : -- What is your father ?\nStephen had answered : -- A gentleman .\nThen Nasty Roche had asked : -- Is he a magistrate ?\nHe crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line , making little runs now and then .\nBut his hands were bluish with cold .\nHe kept his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit .\nThat was a belt round his pocket .\nAnd belt was also to give a fellow a belt .\nOne day a fellow said to Cantwell : -- I 'd give you such a belt in a second .\nCantwell had answered : -- Go and fight your match .\nGive Cecil Thunder a belt .\nI 'd like to see you .\nHe 'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself .\nThat was not a nice expression .\nHis mother had told him not to speak with the rough boys in the college .\nNice mother !\nThe first day in the hall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veil double to her nose to kiss him : and her nose and eyes were red .\nBut he had pretended not to see that she was going to cry .\nShe was a nice mother but she was not so nice when she cried .\nAnd his father had given him two five-shilling pieces for pocket money .\nAnd his father had told him if he wanted anything to write home to him and , whatever he did , never to peach on a fellow .\nThen at the door of the castle the rector had shaken hands with his father and mother , his soutane fluttering in the breeze , and the car had driven off with his father and mother on it .\nThey had cried to him from the car , waving their hands : -- Goodbye , Stephen , goodbye !\n-- Goodbye , Stephen , goodbye !\nHe was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and , fearful of the flashing eyes and muddy boots , bent down to look through the legs .\nThe fellows were struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking and stamping .\nThen Jack Lawton 's yellow boots dodged out the ball and all the other boots and legs ran after .\nHe ran after them a little way and then stopped .\nIt was useless to run on .\nSoon they would be going home for the holidays .\nAfter supper in the study hall he would change the number pasted up inside his desk from seventy-seven to seventy-six .\nIt would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold .\nThe sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle .\nHe wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the ha-ha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows .\nOne day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers ' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate .\nIt was nice and warm to see the lights in the castle .\nIt was like something in a book .\nPerhaps Leicester Abbey was like that .\nAnd there were nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell 's Spelling Book .\nThey were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from .\nWolsey died in Leicester Abbey Where the abbots buried him .\nCanker is a disease of plants , Cancer one of animals .\nIt would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire , leaning his head upon his hands , and think on those sentences .\nHe shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin .\nThat was mean of Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuff box for Wells 's seasoned hacking chestnut , the conqueror of forty .\nHow cold and slimy the water had been !\nA fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum .\nMother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea .\nShe had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell !\nDante knew a lot of things .\nShe had taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon .\nFather Arnall knew more than Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a well-read woman .\nAnd when Dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth : that was heartburn .\nA voice cried far out on the playground : -- All in !\nThen other voices cried from the lower and third lines : -- All in !\nAll in !\nThe players closed around , flushed and muddy , and he went among them , glad to go in .\nRody Kickham held the ball by its greasy lace .\nA fellow asked him to give it one last : but he walked on without even answering the fellow .\nSimon Moonan told him not to because the prefect was looking .\nThe fellow turned to Simon Moonan and said : -- We all know why you speak .\nYou are McGlade 's suck .\nSuck was a queer word .\nThe fellow called Simon Moonan that name because Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect 's false sleeves behind his back and the prefect used to let on to be angry .\nBut the sound was ugly .\nOnce he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through the hole in the basin .\nAnd when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that : suck .\nOnly louder .\nTo remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold and then hot .\nThere were two cocks that you turned and water came out : cold and hot .\nHe felt cold and then a little hot : and he could see the names printed on the cocks .\nThat was a very queer thing .\nAnd the air in the corridor chilled him too .\nIt was queer and wettish .\nBut soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like a little song .\nAlways the same : and when the fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it .\nIt was the hour for sums .\nFather Arnall wrote a hard sum on the board and then said : -- Now then , who will win ?\nGo ahead , York !\nGo ahead , Lancaster !\nStephen tried his best , but the sum was too hard and he felt confused .\nThe little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter .\nHe was no good at sums , but he tried his best so that York might not lose .\nFather Arnall 's face looked very black , but he was not in a wax : he was laughing .\nThen Jack Lawton cracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said : -- Right .\nBravo Lancaster !\nThe red rose wins .\nCome on now , York !\nForge ahead !\nJack Lawton looked over from his side .\nThe little silk badge with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue sailor top on .\nStephen felt his own face red too , thinking of all the bets about who would get first place in elements , Jack Lawton or he .\nSome weeks Jack Lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first .\nHis white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard Father Arnall 's voice .\nThen all his eagerness passed away and he felt his face quite cool .\nHe thought his face must be white because it felt so cool .\nHe could not get out the answer for the sum but it did not matter .\nWhite roses and red roses : those were beautiful colours to think of .\nAnd the cards for first place and second place and third place were beautiful colours too : pink and cream and lavender .\nLavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of .\nPerhaps a wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild rose blossoms on the little green place .\nBut you could not have a green rose .\nBut perhaps somewhere in the world you could .\n",

    "Phase the First : The Maiden I On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott , in the adjoining Vale of Blakemore , or Blackmoor .\nThe pair of legs that carried him were rickety , and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat to the left of a straight line .\nHe occasionally gave a smart nod , as if in confirmation of some opinion , though he was not thinking of anything in particular .\nAn empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm , the nap of his hat was ruffled , a patch being quite worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off .\nPresently he was met by an elderly parson astride on a gray mare , who , as he rode , hummed a wandering tune .\n\" Good night t ' ee , \" said the man with the basket .\n\" Good night , Sir John , \" said the parson .\nThe pedestrian , after another pace or two , halted , and turned round .\n\" Now , sir , begging your pardon ; we met last market-day on this road about this time , and I said ' Good night , ' and you made reply ' _ Good night , Sir John _ , ' as now . \"\n\" I did , \" said the parson .\n\" And once before that -- near a month ago . \"\n\" I may have . \"\n\" Then what might your meaning be in calling me ' Sir John ' these different times , when I be plain Jack Durbeyfield , the haggler ? \"\nThe parson rode a step or two nearer .\n\" It was only my whim , \" he said ; and , after a moment 's hesitation : \" It was on account of a discovery I made some little time ago , whilst I was hunting up pedigrees for the new county history .\nI am Parson Tringham , the antiquary , of Stagfoot Lane .\nDo n't you really know , Durbeyfield , that you are the lineal representative of the ancient and knightly family of the d'Urbervilles , who derive their descent from Sir Pagan d'Urberville , that renowned knight who came from Normandy with William the Conqueror , as appears by Battle Abbey Roll ? \"\n\" Never heard it before , sir ! \"\n\" Well it 's true .\nThrow up your chin a moment , so that I may catch the profile of your face better .\nYes , that 's the d'Urberville nose and chin -- a little debased .\nYour ancestor was one of the twelve knights who assisted the Lord of Estremavilla in Normandy in his conquest of Glamorganshire .\nBranches of your family held manors over all this part of England ; their names appear in the Pipe Rolls in the time of King Stephen .\nIn the reign of King John one of them was rich enough to give a manor to the Knights Hospitallers ; and in Edward the Second 's time your forefather Brian was summoned to Westminster to attend the great Council there .\nYou declined a little in Oliver Cromwell 's time , but to no serious extent , and in Charles the Second 's reign you were made Knights of the Royal Oak for your loyalty .\nAye , there have been generations of Sir Johns among you , and if knighthood were hereditary , like a baronetcy , as it practically was in old times , when men were knighted from father to son , you would be Sir John now . \"\n\" Ye do n't say so ! \"\n\" In short , \" concluded the parson , decisively smacking his leg with his switch , \" there 's hardly such another family in England . \"\n\" Daze my eyes , and is n't there ? \"\nsaid Durbeyfield .\n\" And here have I been knocking about , year after year , from pillar to post , as if I was no more than the commonest feller in the parish ... And how long hev this news about me been knowed , Pa ' son Tringham ? \"\nThe clergyman explained that , as far as he was aware , it had quite died out of knowledge , and could hardly be said to be known at all .\nHis own investigations had begun on a day in the preceding spring when , having been engaged in tracing the vicissitudes of the d'Urberville family , he had observed Durbeyfield 's name on his waggon , and had thereupon been led to make inquiries about his father and grandfather till he had no doubt on the subject .\n\" At first I resolved not to disturb you with such a useless piece of information , \" said he .\n\" However , our impulses are too strong for our judgement sometimes .\nI thought you might perhaps know something of it all the while . \"\n\" Well , I have heard once or twice , 't is true , that my family had seen better days afore they came to Blackmoor .\nBut I took no notice o ' t , thinking it to mean that we had once kept two horses where we now keep only one .\nI 've got a wold silver spoon , and a wold graven seal at home , too ; but , Lord , what 's a spoon and seal ?\n... And to think that I and these noble d'Urbervilles were one flesh all the time .\n'T was said that my gr ' t-granfer had secrets , and did n't care to talk of where he came from ... And where do we raise our smoke , now , parson , if I may make so bold ; I mean , where do we d'Urbervilles live ? \"\n\" You do n't live anywhere .\nYou are extinct -- as a county family . \"\n\" That 's bad . \"\n\" Yes -- what the mendacious family chronicles call extinct in the male line -- that is , gone down -- gone under . \"\n\" Then where do we lie ? \"\n\" At Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill : rows and rows of you in your vaults , with your effigies under Purbeck-marble canopies . \"\n\" And where be our family mansions and estates ? \"\n\" You have n't any . \"\n\" Oh ?\nNo lands neither ? \"\n\" None ; though you once had 'em in abundance , as I said , for you family consisted of numerous branches .\nIn this county there was a seat of yours at Kingsbere , and another at Sherton , and another in Millpond , and another at Lullstead , and another at Wellbridge . \"\n\" And shall we ever come into our own again ? \"\n\" Ah -- that I ca n't tell ! \"\n\" And what had I better do about it , sir ? \"\nasked Durbeyfield , after a pause .\n\" Oh -- nothing , nothing ; except chasten yourself with the thought of ' how are the mighty fallen . '\nIt is a fact of some interest to the local historian and genealogist , nothing more .\nThere are several families among the cottagers of this county of almost equal lustre .\nGood night . \"\n\" But you 'll turn back and have a quart of beer wi ' me on the strength o ' t , Pa ' son Tringham ?\nThere 's a very pretty brew in tap at The Pure Drop -- though , to be sure , not so good as at Rolliver 's . \"\n\" No , thank you -- not this evening , Durbeyfield .\nYou 've had enough already . \"\nConcluding thus , the parson rode on his way , with doubts as to his discretion in retailing this curious bit of lore .\nWhen he was gone , Durbeyfield walked a few steps in a profound reverie , and then sat down upon the grassy bank by the roadside , depositing his basket before him .\nIn a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance , walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by Durbeyfield .\nThe latter , on seeing him , held up his hand , and the lad quickened his pace and came near .\n\" Boy , take up that basket !\nI want ' ee to go on an errand for me . \"\nThe lath-like stripling frowned .\n\" Who be you , then , John Durbeyfield , to order me about and call me ' boy ' ?\nYou know my name as well as I know yours ! \"\n\" Do you , do you ?\nThat 's the secret -- that 's the secret !\nNow obey my orders , and take the message I 'm going to charge ' ee wi ' ... Well , Fred , I do n't mind telling you that the secret is that I 'm one of a noble race -- it has been just found out by me this present afternoon , P.M. \" And as he made the announcement , Durbeyfield , declining from his sitting position , luxuriously stretched himself out upon the bank among the daisies .\nThe lad stood before Durbeyfield , and contemplated his length from crown to toe .\n\" Sir John d'Urberville -- that 's who I am , \" continued the prostrate man .\n\" That is if knights were baronets -- which they be .\n'T is recorded in history all about me .\nDost know of such a place , lad , as Kingsbere-sub-Greenhill ? \"\n\" Ees .\nI 've been there to Greenhill Fair . \"\n\" Well , under the church of that city there lie -- \" \" 'T is n't a city , the place I mean ; leastwise ' twaddn ' when I was there -- 't was a little one-eyed , blinking sort o ' place . \"\n\" Never you mind the place , boy , that 's not the question before us .\nUnder the church of that there parish lie my ancestors -- hundreds of 'em -- in coats of mail and jewels , in gr ' t lead coffins weighing tons and tons .\nThere 's not a man in the county o ' South-Wessex that 's got grander and nobler skillentons in his family than I. \" \" Oh ? \"\n\" Now take up that basket , and goo on to Marlott , and when you 've come to The Pure Drop Inn , tell 'em to send a horse and carriage to me immed ' ately , to carry me hwome .\nAnd in the bottom o ' the carriage they be to put a noggin o ' rum in a small bottle , and chalk it up to my account .\nAnd when you 've done that goo on to my house with the basket , and tell my wife to put away that washing , because she need n't finish it , and wait till I come hwome , as I 've news to tell her . \"\nAs the lad stood in a dubious attitude , Durbeyfield put his hand in his pocket , and produced a shilling , one of the chronically few that he possessed .\n\" Here 's for your labour , lad . \"\nThis made a difference in the young man 's estimate of the position .\n",

    "CHAPTER I. Mrs. Rachel Lynde is Surprised | MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down into a little hollow , fringed with alders and ladies ’ eardrops and traversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the old Cuthbert place ; it was reputed to be an intricate , headlong brook in its earlier course through those woods , with dark secrets of pool and cascade ; but by the time it reached Lynde ’s Hollow it was a quiet , well-conducted little stream , for not even a brook could run past Mrs. Rachel Lynde ’s door without due regard for decency and decorum ; it probably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window , keeping a sharp eye on everything that passed , from brooks and children up , and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never rest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof .\nThere are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it , who can attend closely to their neighbor ’s business by dint of neglecting their own ; but Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage their own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain .\nShe was a notable housewife ; her work was always done and well done ; she “ ran ” the Sewing Circle , helped run the Sunday-school , and was the strongest prop of the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary .\nYet with all this Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen window , knitting “ cotton warp ” quilts -- she had knitted sixteen of them , as Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices -- and keeping a sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up the steep red hill beyond .\nSince Avonlea occupied a little triangular peninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two sides of it , anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that hill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel ’s all-seeing eye .\nShe was sitting there one afternoon in early June .\nThe sun was coming in at the window warm and bright ; the orchard on the slope below the house was in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom , hummed over by a myriad of bees .\nThomas Lynde -- a meek little man whom Avonlea people called “ Rachel Lynde ’s husband ” -- was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field beyond the barn ; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on the big red brook field away over by Green Gables .\nMrs. Rachel knew that he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening before in William J. Blair ’s store over at Carmody that he meant to sow his turnip seed the next afternoon .\nPeter had asked him , of course , for Matthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about anything in his whole life .\nAnd yet here was Matthew Cuthbert , at half-past three on the afternoon of a busy day , placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill ; moreover , he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes , which was plain proof that he was going out of Avonlea ; and he had the buggy and the sorrel mare , which betokened that he was going a considerable distance .\nNow , where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going there ?\nHad it been any other man in Avonlea , Mrs. Rachel , deftly putting this and that together , might have given a pretty good guess as to both questions .\nBut Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be something pressing and unusual which was taking him ; he was the shyest man alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where he might have to talk .\nMatthew , dressed up with a white collar and driving in a buggy , was something that did n’t happen often .\nMrs. Rachel , ponder as she might , could make nothing of it and her afternoon ’s enjoyment was spoiled .\n“ I ’ll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla where he ’s gone and why , ” the worthy woman finally concluded .\n“ He does n’t generally go to town this time of year and he _ never _ visits ; if he ’d run out of turnip seed he would n’t dress up and take the buggy to go for more ; he was n’t driving fast enough to be going for a doctor .\nYet something must have happened since last night to start him off .\nI ’m clean puzzled , that ’s what , and I wo n’t know a minute ’s peace of mind or conscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea today . ”\nAccordingly after tea Mrs. Rachel set out ; she had not far to go ; the big , rambling , orchard-embowered house where the Cuthberts lived was a scant quarter of a mile up the road from Lynde ’s Hollow .\nTo be sure , the long lane made it a good deal further .\nMatthew Cuthbert ’s father , as shy and silent as his son after him , had got as far away as he possibly could from his fellow men without actually retreating into the woods when he founded his homestead .\nGreen Gables was built at the furthest edge of his cleared land and there it was to this day , barely visible from the main road along which all the other Avonlea houses were so sociably situated .\nMrs. Rachel Lynde did not call living in such a place _ living _ at all .\n“ It ’s just _ staying _ , that ’s what , ” she said as she stepped along the deep-rutted , grassy lane bordered with wild rose bushes .\n“ It ’s no wonder Matthew and Marilla are both a little odd , living away back here by themselves .\nTrees are n’t much company , though dear knows if they were there ’d be enough of them .\nI ’d ruther look at people .\nTo be sure , they seem contented enough ; but then , I suppose , they ’re used to it .\nA body can get used to anything , even to being hanged , as the Irishman said . ”\nWith this Mrs. Rachel stepped out of the lane into the backyard of Green Gables .\nVery green and neat and precise was that yard , set about on one side with great patriarchal willows and the other with prim Lombardies .\nNot a stray stick nor stone was to be seen , for Mrs. Rachel would have seen it if there had been .\nPrivately she was of the opinion that Marilla Cuthbert swept that yard over as often as she swept her house .\nOne could have eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial peck of dirt .\nMrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in when bidden to do so .\nThe kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful apartment -- or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully clean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor .\nIts windows looked east and west ; through the west one , looking out on the back yard , came a flood of mellow June sunlight ; but the east one , whence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left orchard and nodding , slender birches down in the hollow by the brook , was greened over by a tangle of vines .\nHere sat Marilla Cuthbert , when she sat at all , always slightly distrustful of sunshine , which seemed to her too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to be taken seriously ; and here she sat now , knitting , and the table behind her was laid for supper .\nMrs. Rachel , before she had fairly closed the door , had taken a mental note of everything that was on that table .\nThere were three plates laid , so that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea ; but the dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves and one kind of cake , so that the expected company could not be any particular company .\nYet what of Matthew ’s white collar and the sorrel mare ?\nMrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery about quiet , unmysterious Green Gables .\n“ Good evening , Rachel , ” Marilla said briskly .\n“ This is a real fine evening , is n’t it ?\nWo n’t you sit down ?\nHow are all your folks ? ”\nSomething that for lack of any other name might be called friendship existed and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel , in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- their dissimilarity .\nMarilla was a tall , thin woman , with angles and without curves ; her dark hair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little knot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it .\nShe looked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience , which she was ; but there was a saving something about her mouth which , if it had been ever so slightly developed , might have been considered indicative of a sense of humor .\n“ We ’re all pretty well , ” said Mrs. Rachel .\n“ I was kind of afraid _ you _ were n’t , though , when I saw Matthew starting off today .\nI thought maybe he was going to the doctor ’s . ”\nMarilla ’s lips twitched understandingly .\nShe had expected Mrs. Rachel up ; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so unaccountably would be too much for her neighbor ’s curiosity .\n“ Oh , no , I ’m quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday , ” she said .\n“ Matthew went to Bright River .\nWe ’re getting a little boy from an orphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he ’s coming on the train tonight . ”\nIf Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a kangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished .\nShe was actually stricken dumb for five seconds .\nIt was unsupposable that Marilla was making fun of her , but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to suppose it .\n“ Are you in earnest , Marilla ? ” she demanded when voice returned to her .\n“ Yes , of course , ” said Marilla , as if getting boys from orphan asylums in Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated Avonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation .\nMrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt .\nShe thought in exclamation points .\nA boy !\nMarilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people adopting a boy !\nFrom an orphan asylum !\nWell , the world was certainly turning upside down !\nShe would be surprised at nothing after this !\nNothing !\n",

    "I A green and yellow parrot , which hung in a cage outside the door , kept repeating over and over : “ Allez vous-en !\nAllez vous-en !\nSapristi !\nThat 's all right ! ”\nHe could speak a little Spanish , and also a language which nobody understood , unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other side of the door , whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with maddening persistence .\nMr. Pontellier , unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort , arose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust .\nHe walked down the gallery and across the narrow “ bridges ” which connected the Lebrun cottages one with the other .\nHe had been seated before the door of the main house .\nThe parrot and the mockingbird were the property of Madame Lebrun , and they had the right to make all the noise they wished .\nMr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their society when they ceased to be entertaining .\nHe stopped before the door of his own cottage , which was the fourth one from the main building and next to the last .\nSeating himself in a wicker rocker which was there , he once more applied himself to the task of reading the newspaper .\nThe day was Sunday ; the paper was a day old .\nThe Sunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle .\nHe was already acquainted with the market reports , and he glanced restlessly over the editorials and bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New Orleans the day before .\nMr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses .\nHe was a man of forty , of medium height and rather slender build ; he stooped a little .\nHis hair was brown and straight , parted on one side .\nHis beard was neatly and closely trimmed .\nOnce in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked about him .\nThere was more noise than ever over at the house .\nThe main building was called “ the house , ” to distinguish it from the cottages .\nThe chattering and whistling birds were still at it .\nTwo young girls , the Farival twins , were playing a duet from “ Zampa ” upon the piano .\nMadame Lebrun was bustling in and out , giving orders in a high key to a yard-boy whenever she got inside the house , and directions in an equally high voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside .\nShe was a fresh , pretty woman , clad always in white with elbow sleeves .\nHer starched skirts crinkled as she came and went .\nFarther down , before one of the cottages , a lady in black was walking demurely up and down , telling her beads .\nA good many persons of the pension had gone over to the Cheniere Caminada in Beaudelet 's lugger to hear mass .\nSome young people were out under the wateroaks playing croquet .\nMr. Pontellier 's two children were there -- sturdy little fellows of four and five .\nA quadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway , meditative air .\nMr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke , letting the paper drag idly from his hand .\nHe fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that was advancing at snail 's pace from the beach .\nHe could see it plainly between the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of yellow camomile .\nThe gulf looked far away , melting hazily into the blue of the horizon .\nThe sunshade continued to approach slowly .\nBeneath its pink-lined shelter were his wife , Mrs. Pontellier , and young Robert Lebrun .\nWhen they reached the cottage , the two seated themselves with some appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch , facing each other , each leaning against a supporting post .\n“ What folly !\nto bathe at such an hour in such heat ! ”\nexclaimed Mr. Pontellier .\nHe himself had taken a plunge at daylight .\nThat was why the morning seemed long to him .\n“ You are burnt beyond recognition , ” he added , looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some damage .\nShe held up her hands , strong , shapely hands , and surveyed them critically , drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists .\nLooking at them reminded her of her rings , which she had given to her husband before leaving for the beach .\nShe silently reached out to him , and he , understanding , took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them into her open palm .\nShe slipped them upon her fingers ; then clasping her knees , she looked across at Robert and began to laugh .\nThe rings sparkled upon her fingers .\nHe sent back an answering smile .\n“ What is it ? ”\nasked Pontellier , looking lazily and amused from one to the other .\nIt was some utter nonsense ; some adventure out there in the water , and they both tried to relate it at once .\nIt did not seem half so amusing when told .\nThey realized this , and so did Mr. Pontellier .\nHe yawned and stretched himself .\nThen he got up , saying he had half a mind to go over to Klein 's hotel and play a game of billiards .\n“ Come go along , Lebrun , ” he proposed to Robert .\nBut Robert admitted quite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs. Pontellier .\n“ Well , send him about his business when he bores you , Edna , ” instructed her husband as he prepared to leave .\n“ Here , take the umbrella , ” she exclaimed , holding it out to him .\nHe accepted the sunshade , and lifting it over his head descended the steps and walked away .\n“ Coming back to dinner ? ”\nhis wife called after him .\nHe halted a moment and shrugged his shoulders .\nHe felt in his vest pocket ; there was a ten-dollar bill there .\nHe did not know ; perhaps he would return for the early dinner and perhaps he would not .\nIt all depended upon the company which he found over at Klein 's and the size of “ the game . ”\nHe did not say this , but she understood it , and laughed , nodding good-by to him .\nBoth children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting out .\nHe kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts .\nII Mrs. Pontellier 's eyes were quick and bright ; they were a yellowish brown , about the color of her hair .\nShe had a way of turning them swiftly upon an object and holding them there as if lost in some inward maze of contemplation or thought .\nHer eyebrows were a shade darker than her hair .\nThey were thick and almost horizontal , emphasizing the depth of her eyes .\nShe was rather handsome than beautiful .\nHer face was captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features .\nHer manner was engaging .\nRobert rolled a cigarette .\nHe smoked cigarettes because he could not afford cigars , he said .\nHe had a cigar in his pocket which Mr. Pontellier had presented him with , and he was saving it for his after-dinner smoke .\nThis seemed quite proper and natural on his part .\nIn coloring he was not unlike his companion .\nA clean-shaved face made the resemblance more pronounced than it would otherwise have been .\nThere rested no shadow of care upon his open countenance .\nHis eyes gathered in and reflected the light and languor of the summer day .\nMrs. Pontellier reached over for a palm-leaf fan that lay on the porch and began to fan herself , while Robert sent between his lips light puffs from his cigarette .\nThey chatted incessantly : about the things around them ; their amusing adventure out in the water -- it had again assumed its entertaining aspect ; about the wind , the trees , the people who had gone to the Cheniere ; about the children playing croquet under the oaks , and the Farival twins , who were now performing the overture to “ The Poet and the Peasant . ”\nRobert talked a good deal about himself .\nHe was very young , and did not know any better .\nMrs. Pontellier talked a little about herself for the same reason .\nEach was interested in what the other said .\nRobert spoke of his intention to go to Mexico in the autumn , where fortune awaited him .\nHe was always intending to go to Mexico , but some way never got there .\nMeanwhile he held on to his modest position in a mercantile house in New Orleans , where an equal familiarity with English , French and Spanish gave him no small value as a clerk and correspondent .\nHe was spending his summer vacation , as he always did , with his mother at Grand Isle .\nIn former times , before Robert could remember , “ the house ” had been a summer luxury of the Lebruns .\nNow , flanked by its dozen or more cottages , which were always filled with exclusive visitors from the “ Quartier Francais , ” it enabled Madame Lebrun to maintain the easy and comfortable existence which appeared to be her birthright .\nMrs. Pontellier talked about her father 's Mississippi plantation and her girlhood home in the old Kentucky bluegrass country .\nShe was an American woman , with a small infusion of French which seemed to have been lost in dilution .\nShe read a letter from her sister , who was away in the East , and who had engaged herself to be married .\nRobert was interested , and wanted to know what manner of girls the sisters were , what the father was like , and how long the mother had been dead .\nWhen Mrs. Pontellier folded the letter it was time for her to dress for the early dinner .\n“ I see Leonce is n't coming back , ” she said , with a glance in the direction whence her husband had disappeared .\nRobert supposed he was not , as there were a good many New Orleans club men over at Klein 's .\nWhen Mrs. Pontellier left him to enter her room , the young man descended the steps and strolled over toward the croquet players , where , during the half-hour before dinner , he amused himself with the little Pontellier children , who were very fond of him .\nIII It was eleven o'clock that night when Mr. Pontellier returned from Klein 's hotel .\nHe was in an excellent humor , in high spirits , and very talkative .\nHis entrance awoke his wife , who was in bed and fast asleep when he came in .\nHe talked to her while he undressed , telling her anecdotes and bits of news and gossip that he had gathered during the day .\nFrom his trousers pockets he took a fistful of crumpled bank notes and a good deal of silver coin , which he piled on the bureau indiscriminately with keys , knife , handkerchief , and whatever else happened to be in his pockets .\nShe was overcome with sleep , and answered him with little half utterances .\n",

    "May 7th .\n-- I love my garden .\nI am writing in it now in the late afternoon loveliness , much interrupted by the mosquitoes and the temptation to look at all the glories of the new green leaves washed half an hour ago in a cold shower .\nTwo owls are perched near me , and are carrying on a long conversation that I enjoy as much as any warbling of nightingales .\nThe gentleman owl says [ [ musical notes occur here in the printed text ] ] , and she answers from her tree a little way off , [ [ musical notes ] ] , beautifully assenting to and completing her lord ’s remark , as becomes a properly constructed German she-owl .\nThey say the same thing over and over again so emphatically that I think it must be something nasty about me ; but I shall not let myself be frightened away by the sarcasm of owls .\nThis is less a garden than a wilderness .\nNo one has lived in the house , much less in the garden , for twenty-five years , and it is such a pretty old place that the people who might have lived here and did not , deliberately preferring the horrors of a flat in a town , must have belonged to that vast number of eyeless and earless persons of whom the world seems chiefly composed .\nNoseless too , though it does not sound pretty ; but the greater part of my spring happiness is due to the scent of the wet earth and young leaves .\nI am always happy ( out of doors be it understood , for indoors there are servants and furniture ) but in quite different ways , and my spring happiness bears no resemblance to my summer or autumn happiness , though it is not more intense , and there were days last winter when I danced for sheer joy out in my frost-bound garden , in spite of my years and children .\nBut I did it behind a bush , having a due regard for the decencies .\nThere are so many bird-cherries round me , great trees with branches sweeping the grass , and they are so wreathed just now with white blossoms and tenderest green that the garden looks like a wedding .\nI never saw such masses of them ; they seemed to fill the place .\nEven across a little stream that bounds the garden on the east , and right in the middle of the cornfield beyond , there is an immense one , a picture of grace and glory against the cold blue of the spring sky .\nMy garden is surrounded by cornfields and meadows , and beyond are great stretches of sandy heath and pine forests , and where the forests leave off the bare heath begins again ; but the forests are beautiful in their lofty , pink-stemmed vastness , far overhead the crowns of softest gray-green , and underfoot a bright green wortleberry carpet , and everywhere the breathless silence ; and the bare heaths are beautiful too , for one can see across them into eternity almost , and to go out on to them with one ’s face towards the setting sun is like going into the very presence of God .\nIn the middle of this plain is the oasis of birdcherries and greenery where I spend my happy days , and in the middle of the oasis is the gray stone house with many gables where I pass my reluctant nights .\nThe house is very old , and has been added to at various times .\nIt was a convent before the Thirty Years ’ War , and the vaulted chapel , with its brick floor worn by pious peasant knees , is now used as a hall .\nGustavus Adolphus and his Swedes passed through more than once , as is duly recorded in archives still preserved , for we are on what was then the high-road between Sweden and Brandenburg the unfortunate .\nThe Lion of the North was no doubt an estimable person and acted wholly up to his convictions , but he must have sadly upset the peaceful nuns , who were not without convictions of their own , sending them out on to the wide , empty plain to piteously seek some life to replace the life of silence here .\nFrom nearly all the windows of the house I can look out across the plain , with no obstacle in the shape of a hill , right away to a blue line of distant forest , and on the west side uninterruptedly to the setting sun -- nothing but a green , rolling plain , with a sharp edge against the sunset .\nI love those west windows better than any others , and have chosen my bedroom on that side of the house so that even times of hair-brushing may not be entirely lost , and the young woman who attends to such matters has been taught to fulfil her duties about a mistress recumbent in an easychair before an open window , and not to profane with chatter that sweet and solemn time .\nThis girl is grieved at my habit of living almost in the garden , and all her ideas as to the sort of life a respectable German lady should lead have got into a sad muddle since she came to me .\nThe people round about are persuaded that I am , to put it as kindly as possible , exceedingly eccentric , for the news has travelled that I spend the day out of doors with a book , and that no mortal eye has ever yet seen me sew or cook .\nBut why cook when you can get some one to cook for you ?\nAnd as for sewing , the maids will hem the sheets better and quicker than I could , and all forms of needlework of the fancy order are inventions of the evil one for keeping the foolish from applying their heart to wisdom .\nWe had been married five years before it struck us that we might as well make use of this place by coming down and living in it .\nThose five years were spent in a flat in a town , and during their whole interminable length I was perfectly miserable and perfectly healthy , which disposes of the ugly notion that has at times disturbed me that my happiness here is less due to the garden than to a good digestion .\nAnd while we were wasting our lives there , here was this dear place with dandelions up to the very door , all the paths grass-grown and completely effaced , in winter so lonely , with nobody but the north wind taking the least notice of it , and in May -- in all those five lovely Mays -- no one to look at the wonderful bird-cherries and still more wonderful masses of lilacs , everything glowing and blowing , the virginia creeper madder every year , until at last , in October , the very roof was wreathed with blood-red tresses , the owls and the squirrels and all the blessed little birds reigning supreme , and not a living creature ever entering the empty house except the snakes , which got into the habit during those silent years of wriggling up the south wall into the rooms on that side whenever the old housekeeper opened the windows .\nAll that was here , -- peace , and happiness , and a reasonable life , -- and yet it never struck me to come and live in it .\nLooking back I am astonished , and can in no way account for the tardiness of my discovery that here , in this far-away corner , was my kingdom of heaven .\nIndeed , so little did it enter my head to even use the place in summer , that I submitted to weeks of seaside life with all its horrors every year ; until at last , in the early spring of last year , having come down for the opening of the village school , and wandering out afterwards into the bare and desolate garden , I do n’t know what smell of wet earth or rotting leaves brought back my childhood with a rush and all the happy days I had spent in a garden .\nShall I ever forget that day ?\nIt was the beginning of my real life , my coming of age as it were , and entering into my kingdom .\nEarly March , gray , quiet skies , and brown , quiet earth ; leafless and sad and lonely enough out there in the damp and silence , yet there I stood feeling the same rapture of pure delight in the first breath of spring that I used to as a child , and the five wasted years fell from me like a cloak , and the world was full of hope , and I vowed myself then and there to nature , and have been happy ever since .\nMy other half being indulgent , and with some faint thought perhaps that it might be as well to look after the place , consented to live in it at any rate for a time ; whereupon followed six specially blissful weeks from the end of April into June , during which I was here alone , supposed to be superintending the painting and papering , but as a matter of fact only going into the house when the workmen had gone out of it .\nHow happy I was !\nI do n’t remember any time quite so perfect since the days when I was too little to do lessons and was turned out with sugar on my eleven o’clock bread and butter on to a lawn closely strewn with dandelions and daisies .\nThe sugar on the bread and butter has lost its charm , but I love the dandelions and daisies even more passionately now than then , and never would endure to see them all mown away if I were not certain that in a day or two they would be pushing up their little faces again as jauntily as ever .\nDuring those six weeks I lived in a world of dandelions and delights .\nThe dandelions carpeted the three lawns , -- they used to be lawns , but have long since blossomed out into meadows filled with every sort of pretty weed , -- and under and among the groups of leafless oaks and beeches were blue hepaticas , white anemones , violets , and celandines in sheets .\nThe celandines in particular delighted me with their clean , happy brightness , so beautifully trim and newly varnished , as though they too had had the painters at work on them .\nThen , when the anemones went , came a few stray periwinkles and Solomon ’s Seal , and all the birdcherries blossomed in a burst .\nAnd then , before I had a little got used to the joy of their flowers against the sky , came the lilacs -- masses and masses of them , in clumps on the grass , with other shrubs and trees by the side of walks , and one great continuous bank of them half a mile long right past the west front of the house , away down as far as one could see , shining glorious against a background of firs .\nWhen that time came , and when , before it was over , the acacias all blossomed too , and four great clumps of pale , silvery-pink peonies flowered under the south windows , I felt so absolutely happy , and blest , and thankful , and grateful , that I really can not describe it .\nMy days seemed to melt away in a dream of pink and purple peace .\n",

    "VOLUME 1 CHAPTER I home is the resort Of love , of joy , of peace and plenty , where , Supporting and supported , polish 'd friends And dear relations mingle into bliss .\n* * Thomson On the pleasant banks of the Garonne , in the province of Gascony , stood , in the year 1584 , the chateau of Monsieur St. Aubert .\nFrom its windows were seen the pastoral landscapes of Guienne and Gascony stretching along the river , gay with luxuriant woods and vine , and plantations of olives .\nTo the south , the view was bounded by the majestic Pyrenees , whose summits , veiled in clouds , or exhibiting awful forms , seen , and lost again , as the partial vapours rolled along , were sometimes barren , and gleamed through the blue tinge of air , and sometimes frowned with forests of gloomy pine , that swept downward to their base .\nThese tremendous precipices were contrasted by the soft green of the pastures and woods that hung upon their skirts ; among whose flocks , and herds , and simple cottages , the eye , after having scaled the cliffs above , delighted to repose .\nTo the north , and to the east , the plains of Guienne and Languedoc were lost in the mist of distance ; on the west , Gascony was bounded by the waters of Biscay .\nM. St. Aubert loved to wander , with his wife and daughter , on the margin of the Garonne , and to listen to the music that floated on its waves .\nHe had known life in other forms than those of pastoral simplicity , having mingled in the gay and in the busy scenes of the world ; but the flattering portrait of mankind , which his heart had delineated in early youth , his experience had too sorrowfully corrected .\nYet , amidst the changing visions of life , his principles remained unshaken , his benevolence unchilled ; and he retired from the multitude ' more in PITY than in anger , ' to scenes of simple nature , to the pure delights of literature , and to the exercise of domestic virtues .\nHe was a descendant from the younger branch of an illustrious family , and it was designed , that the deficiency of his patrimonial wealth should be supplied either by a splendid alliance in marriage , or by success in the intrigues of public affairs .\nBut St. Aubert had too nice a sense of honour to fulfil the latter hope , and too small a portion of ambition to sacrifice what he called happiness , to the attainment of wealth .\nAfter the death of his father he married a very amiable woman , his equal in birth , and not his superior in fortune .\nThe late Monsieur St. Aubert 's liberality , or extravagance , had so much involved his affairs , that his son found it necessary to dispose of a part of the family domain , and , some years after his marriage , he sold it to Monsieur Quesnel , the brother of his wife , and retired to a small estate in Gascony , where conjugal felicity , and parental duties , divided his attention with the treasures of knowledge and the illuminations of genius .\nTo this spot he had been attached from his infancy .\nHe had often made excursions to it when a boy , and the impressions of delight given to his mind by the homely kindness of the grey-headed peasant , to whom it was intrusted , and whose fruit and cream never failed , had not been obliterated by succeeding circumstances .\nThe green pastures along which he had so often bounded in the exultation of health , and youthful freedom -- the woods , under whose refreshing shade he had first indulged that pensive melancholy , which afterwards made a strong feature of his character -- the wild walks of the mountains , the river , on whose waves he had floated , and the distant plains , which seemed boundless as his early hopes -- were never after remembered by St. Aubert but with enthusiasm and regret .\nAt length he disengaged himself from the world , and retired hither , to realize the wishes of many years .\nThe building , as it then stood , was merely a summer cottage , rendered interesting to a stranger by its neat simplicity , or the beauty of the surrounding scene ; and considerable additions were necessary to make it a comfortable family residence .\nSt. Aubert felt a kind of affection for every part of the fabric , which he remembered in his youth , and would not suffer a stone of it to be removed , so that the new building , adapted to the style of the old one , formed with it only a simple and elegant residence .\nThe taste of Madame St. Aubert was conspicuous in its internal finishing , where the same chaste simplicity was observable in the furniture , and in the few ornaments of the apartments , that characterized the manners of its inhabitants .\nThe library occupied the west side of the chateau , and was enriched by a collection of the best books in the ancient and modern languages .\nThis room opened upon a grove , which stood on the brow of a gentle declivity , that fell towards the river , and the tall trees gave it a melancholy and pleasing shade ; while from the windows the eye caught , beneath the spreading branches , the gay and luxuriant landscape stretching to the west , and overlooked on the left by the bold precipices of the Pyrenees .\nAdjoining the library was a green-house , stored with scarce and beautiful plants ; for one of the amusements of St. Aubert was the study of botany , and among the neighbouring mountains , which afforded a luxurious feast to the mind of the naturalist , he often passed the day in the pursuit of his favourite science .\nHe was sometimes accompanied in these little excursions by Madame St. Aubert , and frequently by his daughter ; when , with a small osier basket to receive plants , and another filled with cold refreshments , such as the cabin of the shepherd did not afford , they wandered away among the most romantic and magnificent scenes , nor suffered the charms of Nature 's lowly children to abstract them from the observance of her stupendous works .\nWhen weary of sauntering among cliffs that seemed scarcely accessible but to the steps of the enthusiast , and where no track appeared on the vegetation , but what the foot of the izard had left ; they would seek one of those green recesses , which so beautifully adorn the bosom of these mountains , where , under the shade of the lofty larch , or cedar , they enjoyed their simple repast , made sweeter by the waters of the cool stream , that crept along the turf , and by the breath of wild flowers and aromatic plants , that fringed the rocks , and inlaid the grass .\nAdjoining the eastern side of the green-house , looking towards the plains of Languedoc , was a room , which Emily called hers , and which contained her books , her drawings , her musical instruments , with some favourite birds and plants .\nHere she usually exercised herself in elegant arts , cultivated only because they were congenial to her taste , and in which native genius , assisted by the instructions of Monsieur and Madame St. Aubert , made her an early proficient .\nThe windows of this room were particularly pleasant ; they descended to the floor , and , opening upon the little lawn that surrounded the house , the eye was led between groves of almond , palm-trees , flowering-ash , and myrtle , to the distant landscape , where the Garonne wandered .\nThe peasants of this gay climate were often seen on an evening , when the day 's labour was done , dancing in groups on the margin of the river .\nTheir sprightly melodies , debonnaire steps , the fanciful figure of their dances , with the tasteful and capricious manner in which the girls adjusted their simple dress , gave a character to the scene entirely French .\nThe front of the chateau , which , having a southern aspect , opened upon the grandeur of the mountains , was occupied on the ground floor by a rustic hall , and two excellent sitting rooms .\nThe first floor , for the cottage had no second story , was laid out in bed-chambers , except one apartment that opened to a balcony , and which was generally used for a breakfast-room .\nIn the surrounding ground , St. Aubert had made very tasteful improvements ; yet , such was his attachment to objects he had remembered from his boyish days , that he had in some instances sacrificed taste to sentiment .\nThere were two old larches that shaded the building , and interrupted the prospect ; St. Aubert had sometimes declared that he believed he should have been weak enough to have wept at their fall .\nIn addition to these larches he planted a little grove of beech , pine , and mountain-ash .\nOn a lofty terrace , formed by the swelling bank of the river , rose a plantation of orange , lemon , and palm-trees , whose fruit , in the coolness of evening , breathed delicious fragrance .\nWith these were mingled a few trees of other species .\nHere , under the ample shade of a plane-tree , that spread its majestic canopy towards the river , St. Aubert loved to sit in the fine evenings of summer , with his wife and children , watching , beneath its foliage , the setting sun , the mild splendour of its light fading from the distant landscape , till the shadows of twilight melted its various features into one tint of sober grey .\nHere , too , he loved to read , and to converse with Madame St. Aubert ; or to play with his children , resigning himself to the influence of those sweet affections , which are ever attendant on simplicity and nature .\nHe has often said , while tears of pleasure trembled in his eyes , that these were moments infinitely more delightful than any passed amid the brilliant and tumultuous scenes that are courted by the world .\nHis heart was occupied ; it had , what can be so rarely said , no wish for a happiness beyond what it experienced .\nThe consciousness of acting right diffused a serenity over his manners , which nothing else could impart to a man of moral perceptions like his , and which refined his sense of every surrounding blessing .\nThe deepest shade of twilight did not send him from his favourite plane-tree .\nHe loved the soothing hour , when the last tints of light die away ; when the stars , one by one , tremble through aether , and are reflected on the dark mirror of the waters ; that hour , which , of all others , inspires the mind with pensive tenderness , and often elevates it to sublime contemplation .\nWhen the moon shed her soft rays among the foliage , he still lingered , and his pastoral supper of cream and fruits was often spread beneath it .\nThen , on the stillness of night , came the song of the nightingale , breathing sweetness , and awakening melancholy .\n",

    "Chapter I Out to Sea I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me , or to any other .\nI may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it , and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale .\nWhen my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much , and that I was prone to doubtfulness , his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced , and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript , and dry official records of the British Colonial Office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative .\nI do not say the story is true , for I did not witness the happenings which it portrays , but the fact that in the telling of it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it MAY be true .\nThe yellow , mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead , and the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host , and so I give you the story as I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies .\nIf you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique , remarkable , and interesting .\nFrom the records of the Colonial Office and from the dead man 's diary we learn that a certain young English nobleman , whom we shall call John Clayton , Lord Greystoke , was commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a British West Coast African Colony from whose simple native inhabitants another European power was known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army , which it used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes along the Congo and the Aruwimi .\nThe natives of the British Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises , but that few if any ever returned to their families .\nThe Englishmen in Africa went even further , saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery , since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers , and they were told that they had yet several years to serve .\nAnd so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West Africa , but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly European power .\nWhy he was sent , is , however , of little moment to this story , for he never made an investigation , nor , in fact , did he ever reach his destination .\nClayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefields -- a strong , virile man -- mentally , morally , and physically .\nIn stature he was above the average height ; his eyes were gray , his features regular and strong ; his carriage that of perfect , robust health influenced by his years of army training .\nPolitical ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him , still young , entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the Queen .\nWhen he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled .\nThe preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service , and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility ; but , on the other hand , he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months , and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him .\nFor her sake he would have refused the appointment , but she would not have it so .\nInstead she insisted that he accept , and , indeed , take her with him .\nThere were mothers and brothers and sisters , and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject , but as to what they severally advised history is silent .\nWe know only that on a bright May morning in 1888 , John , Lord Greystoke , and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa .\nA month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel , the Fuwalda , which was to bear them to their final destination .\nAnd here John , Lord Greystoke , and Lady Alice , his wife , vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men .\nTwo months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel , and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board , and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun ; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years .\nThe Fuwalda , a barkentine of about one hundred tons , was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic , their crews composed of the offscourings of the sea -- unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation .\nThe Fuwalda was no exception to the rule .\nHer officers were swarthy bullies , hating and hated by their crew .\nThe captain , while a competent seaman , was a brute in his treatment of his men .\nHe knew , or at least he used , but two arguments in his dealings with them -- a belaying pin and a revolver -- nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else .\nSo it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea .\nIt was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man .\nTwo sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda , the first mate was on duty , and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice .\nThe men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors .\nCloser and closer they came , until one of them was directly behind the captain .\nIn another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded .\nBut just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke , and , as he did so , tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck , overturning the water-pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents .\nFor an instant the scene was ludicrous ; but only for an instant .\nWith a volley of awful oaths , his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage , the captain regained his feet , and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck .\nThe man was small and rather old , so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated .\nThe other seaman , however , was neither old nor small -- a huge bear of a man , with fierce black mustachios , and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders .\nAs he saw his mate go down he crouched , and , with a low snarl , sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow .\nFrom scarlet the officer 's face went white , for this was mutiny ; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career .\nWithout waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket , firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him ; but , quick as he was , John Clayton was almost as quick , so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor 's heart lodged in the sailor 's leg instead , for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain 's arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun .\nWords passed between Clayton and the captain , the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew , nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers .\nThe captain was on the point of making an angry reply , but , thinking better of it , turned on his heel and black and scowling , strode aft .\nHe did not care to antagonize an English official , for the Queen 's mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate , and which he feared -- England 's far-reaching navy .\nThe two sailors picked themselves up , the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise .\nThe big fellow , who was known among his mates as Black Michael , tried his leg gingerly , and , finding that it bore his weight , turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks .\nThough the fellow 's tone was surly , his words were evidently well meant .\nEre he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation .\nThey did not see him again for several days , nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them .\nThey took their meals in his cabin , as they had before the unfortunate occurrence ; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time .\nThe other officers were coarse , illiterate fellows , but little above the villainous crew they bullied , and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady , so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves .\nThis in itself accorded perfectly with their desires , but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy .\nThere was in the whole atmosphere of the craft that undefinable something which presages disaster .\nOutwardly , to the knowledge of the Claytons , all went on as before upon the little vessel ; but that there was an undertow leading them toward some unknown danger both felt , though they did not speak of it to each other .\nOn the second day after the wounding of Black Michael , Clayton came on deck just in time to see the limp body of one of the crew being carried below by four of his fellows while the first mate , a heavy belaying pin in his hand , stood glowering at the little party of sullen sailors .\n",

    "Chapter 1 The cold passed reluctantly from the earth , and the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched out on the hills , resting .\nAs the landscape changed from brown to green , the army awakened , and began to tremble with eagerness at the noise of rumors .\nIt cast its eyes upon the roads , which were growing from long troughs of liquid mud to proper thoroughfares .\nA river , amber-tinted in the shadow of its banks , purled at the army 's feet ; and at night , when the stream had become of a sorrowful blackness , one could see across it the red , eyelike gleam of hostile camp-fires set in the low brows of distant hills .\nOnce a certain tall soldier developed virtues and went resolutely to wash a shirt .\nHe came flying back from a brook waving his garment bannerlike .\nHe was swelled with a tale he had heard from a reliable friend , who had heard it from a truthful cavalryman , who had heard it from his trustworthy brother , one of the orderlies at division headquarters .\nHe adopted the important air of a herald in red and gold .\n\" We 're goin ' t ' move t ' morrah -- sure , \" he said pompously to a group in the company street .\n\" We 're goin ' ' way up the river , cut across , an ' come around in behint 'em . \"\nTo his attentive audience he drew a loud and elaborate plan of a very brilliant campaign .\nWhen he had finished , the blue-clothed men scattered into small arguing groups between the rows of squat brown huts .\nA negro teamster who had been dancing upon a cracker box with the hilarious encouragement of twoscore soldiers was deserted .\nHe sat mournfully down .\nSmoke drifted lazily from a multitude of quaint chimneys .\n\" It 's a lie !\nthat 's all it is -- a thunderin ' lie ! \"\nsaid another private loudly .\nHis smooth face was flushed , and his hands were thrust sulkily into his trouser 's pockets .\nHe took the matter as an affront to him .\n\" I do n't believe the derned old army 's ever going to move .\nWe 're set .\nI 've got ready to move eight times in the last two weeks , and we ai n't moved yet . \"\nThe tall soldier felt called upon to defend the truth of a rumor he himself had introduced .\nHe and the loud one came near to fighting over it .\nA corporal began to swear before the assemblage .\nHe had just put a costly board floor in his house , he said .\nDuring the early spring he had refrained from adding extensively to the comfort of his environment because he had felt that the army might start on the march at any moment .\nOf late , however , he had been impressed that they were in a sort of eternal camp .\nMany of the men engaged in a spirited debate .\nOne outlined in a peculiarly lucid manner all the plans of the commanding general .\nHe was opposed by men who advocated that there were other plans of campaign .\nThey clamored at each other , numbers making futile bids for the popular attention .\nMeanwhile , the soldier who had fetched the rumor bustled about with much importance .\nHe was continually assailed by questions .\n\" What 's up , Jim ? \"\n\" Th ' army 's goin ' t ' move . \"\n\" Ah , what yeh talkin ' about ?\nHow yeh know it is ? \"\n\" Well , yeh kin b ' lieve me er not , jest as yeh like .\nI do n't care a hang . \"\nThere was much food for thought in the manner in which he replied .\nHe came near to convincing them by disdaining to produce proofs .\nThey grew much excited over it .\nThere was a youthful private who listened with eager ears to the words of the tall soldier and to the varied comments of his comrades .\nAfter receiving a fill of discussions concerning marches and attacks , he went to his hut and crawled through an intricate hole that served it as a door .\nHe wished to be alone with some new thoughts that had lately come to him .\nHe lay down on a wide bunk that stretched across the end of the room .\nIn the other end , cracker boxes were made to serve as furniture .\nThey were grouped about the fireplace .\nA picture from an illustrated weekly was upon the log walls , and three rifles were paralleled on pegs .\nEquipments hung on handy projections , and some tin dishes lay upon a small pile of firewood .\nA folded tent was serving as a roof .\nThe sunlight , without , beating upon it , made it glow a light yellow shade .\nA small window shot an oblique square of whiter light upon the cluttered floor .\nThe smoke from the fire at times neglected the clay chimney and wreathed into the room , and this flimsy chimney of clay and sticks made endless threats to set ablaze the whole establishment .\nThe youth was in a little trance of astonishment .\nSo they were at last going to fight .\nOn the morrow , perhaps , there would be a battle , and he would be in it .\nFor a time he was obliged to labor to make himself believe .\nHe could not accept with assurance an omen that he was about to mingle in one of those great affairs of the earth .\nHe had , of course , dreamed of battles all his life -- of vague and bloody conflicts that had thrilled him with their sweep and fire .\nIn visions he had seen himself in many struggles .\nHe had imagined peoples secure in the shadow of his eagle-eyed prowess .\nBut awake he had regarded battles as crimson blotches on the pages of the past .\nHe had put them as things of the bygone with his thought-images of heavy crowns and high castles .\nThere was a portion of the world 's history which he had regarded as the time of wars , but it , he thought , had been long gone over the horizon and had disappeared forever .\nFrom his home his youthful eyes had looked upon the war in his own country with distrust .\nIt must be some sort of a play affair .\nHe had long despaired of witnessing a Greeklike struggle .\nSuch would be no more , he had said .\nMen were better , or more timid .\nSecular and religious education had effaced the throat-grappling instinct , or else firm finance held in check the passions .\nHe had burned several times to enlist .\nTales of great movements shook the land .\nThey might not be distinctly Homeric , but there seemed to be much glory in them .\nHe had read of marches , sieges , conflicts , and he had longed to see it all .\nHis busy mind had drawn for him large pictures extravagant in color , lurid with breathless deeds .\nBut his mother had discouraged him .\nShe had affected to look with some contempt upon the quality of his war ardor and patriotism .\nShe could calmly seat herself and with no apparent difficulty give him many hundreds of reasons why he was of vastly more importance on the farm than on the field of battle .\nShe had had certain ways of expression that told him that her statements on the subject came from a deep conviction .\nMoreover , on her side , was his belief that her ethical motive in the argument was impregnable .\nAt last , however , he had made firm rebellion against this yellow light thrown upon the color of his ambitions .\nThe newspapers , the gossip of the village , his own picturings , had aroused him to an uncheckable degree .\nThey were in truth fighting finely down there .\nAlmost every day the newspaper printed accounts of a decisive victory .\nOne night , as he lay in bed , the winds had carried to him the clangoring of the church bell as some enthusiast jerked the rope frantically to tell the twisted news of a great battle .\nThis voice of the people rejoicing in the night had made him shiver in a prolonged ecstasy of excitement .\nLater , he had gone down to his mother 's room and had spoken thus : \" Ma , I 'm going to enlist . \"\n\" Henry , do n't you be a fool , \" his mother had replied .\nShe had then covered her face with the quilt .\nThere was an end to the matter for that night .\nNevertheless , the next morning he had gone to a town that was near his mother 's farm and had enlisted in a company that was forming there .\nWhen he had returned home his mother was milking the brindle cow .\nFour others stood waiting .\n\" Ma , I 've enlisted , \" he had said to her diffidently .\nThere was a short silence .\n\" The Lord 's will be done , Henry , \" she had finally replied , and had then continued to milk the brindle cow .\nWhen he had stood in the doorway with his soldier 's clothes on his back , and with the light of excitement and expectancy in his eyes almost defeating the glow of regret for the home bonds , he had seen two tears leaving their trails on his mother 's scarred cheeks .\nStill , she had disappointed him by saying nothing whatever about returning with his shield or on it .\nHe had privately primed himself for a beautiful scene .\nHe had prepared certain sentences which he thought could be used with touching effect .\nBut her words destroyed his plans .\nShe had doggedly peeled potatoes and addressed him as follows : \" You watch out , Henry , an ' take good care of yerself in this here fighting business -- you watch , an ' take good care of yerself .\nDo n't go a-thinkin ' you can lick the hull rebel army at the start , because yeh ca n't .\nYer jest one little feller amongst a hull lot of others , and yeh 've got to keep quiet an ' do what they tell yeh .\nI know how you are , Henry .\n\" I 've knet yeh eight pair of socks , Henry , and I 've put in all yer best shirts , because I want my boy to be jest as warm and comf ' able as anybody in the army .\nWhenever they get holes in 'em , I want yeh to send 'em right-away back to me , so 's I kin dern 'em .\n\" An ' allus be careful an ' choose yer comp ' ny .\nThere 's lots of bad men in the army , Henry .\nThe army makes 'em wild , and they like nothing better than the job of leading off a young feller like you , as ai n't never been away from home much and has allus had a mother , an ' a-learning 'em to drink and swear .\nKeep clear of them folks , Henry .\nI do n't want yeh to ever do anything , Henry , that yeh would be ' shamed to let me know about .\nJest think as if I was a-watchin ' yeh .\nIf yeh keep that in yer mind allus , I guess yeh 'll come out about right .\n",

    "CHAPTER I THE STRANGE MAN 'S ARRIVAL The stranger came early in February , one wintry day , through a biting wind and a driving snow , the last snowfall of the year , over the down , walking from Bramblehurst railway station , and carrying a little black portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand .\nHe was wrapped up from head to foot , and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but the shiny tip of his nose ; the snow had piled itself against his shoulders and chest , and added a white crest to the burden he carried .\nHe staggered into the \" Coach and Horses \" more dead than alive , and flung his portmanteau down .\n\" A fire , \" he cried , \" in the name of human charity !\nA room and a fire ! \"\nHe stamped and shook the snow from off himself in the bar , and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to strike his bargain .\nAnd with that much introduction , that and a couple of sovereigns flung upon the table , he took up his quarters in the inn .\nMrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him a meal with her own hands .\nA guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime was an unheard-of piece of luck , let alone a guest who was no \" haggler , \" and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good fortune .\nAs soon as the bacon was well under way , and Millie , her lymphatic maid , had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen expressions of contempt , she carried the cloth , plates , and glasses into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _ eclat _ .\nAlthough the fire was burning up briskly , she was surprised to see that her visitor still wore his hat and coat , standing with his back to her and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard .\nHis gloved hands were clasped behind him , and he seemed to be lost in thought .\nShe noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his shoulders dripped upon her carpet .\n\" Can I take your hat and coat , sir ? \" she said , \" and give them a good dry in the kitchen ? \"\n\" No , \" he said without turning .\nShe was not sure she had heard him , and was about to repeat her question .\nHe turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder .\n\" I prefer to keep them on , \" he said with emphasis , and she noticed that he wore big blue spectacles with sidelights , and had a bush side-whisker over his coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face .\n\" Very well , sir , \" she said . \"\n_ As _ you like .\nIn a bit the room will be warmer . \"\nHe made no answer , and had turned his face away from her again , and Mrs. Hall , feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed , laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out of the room .\nWhen she returned he was still standing there , like a man of stone , his back hunched , his collar turned up , his dripping hat-brim turned down , hiding his face and ears completely .\nShe put down the eggs and bacon with considerable emphasis , and called rather than said to him , \" Your lunch is served , sir . \"\n\" Thank you , \" he said at the same time , and did not stir until she was closing the door .\nThen he swung round and approached the table with a certain eager quickness .\nAs she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at regular intervals .\nChirk , chirk , chirk , it went , the sound of a spoon being rapidly whisked round a basin .\n\" That girl ! \" she said .\n\" There !\nI clean forgot it .\nIt 's her being so long ! \"\nAnd while she herself finished mixing the mustard , she gave Millie a few verbal stabs for her excessive slowness .\nShe had cooked the ham and eggs , laid the table , and done everything , while Millie ( help indeed ! )\nhad only succeeded in delaying the mustard .\nAnd him a new guest and wanting to stay !\nThen she filled the mustard pot , and , putting it with a certain stateliness upon a gold and black tea-tray , carried it into the parlour .\nShe rapped and entered promptly .\nAs she did so her visitor moved quickly , so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing behind the table .\nIt would seem he was picking something from the floor .\nShe rapped down the mustard pot on the table , and then she noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in front of the fire , and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel fender .\nShe went to these things resolutely .\n\" I suppose I may have them to dry now , \" she said in a voice that brooked no denial .\n\" Leave the hat , \" said her visitor , in a muffled voice , and turning she saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her .\nFor a moment she stood gaping at him , too surprised to speak .\nHe held a white cloth -- it was a serviette he had brought with him -- over the lower part of his face , so that his mouth and jaws were completely hidden , and that was the reason of his muffled voice .\nBut it was not that which startled Mrs. Hall .\nIt was the fact that all his forehead above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage , and that another covered his ears , leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting only his pink , peaked nose .\nIt was bright , pink , and shiny just as it had been at first .\nHe wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high , black , linen-lined collar turned up about his neck .\nThe thick black hair , escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages , projected in curious tails and horns , giving him the strangest appearance conceivable .\nThis muffled and bandaged head was so unlike what she had anticipated , that for a moment she was rigid .\nHe did not remove the serviette , but remained holding it , as she saw now , with a brown gloved hand , and regarding her with his inscrutable blue glasses .\n\" Leave the hat , \" he said , speaking very distinctly through the white cloth .\nHer nerves began to recover from the shock they had received .\nShe placed the hat on the chair again by the fire .\n\" I did n't know , sir , \" she began , \" that -- \" and she stopped embarrassed .\n\" Thank you , \" he said drily , glancing from her to the door and then at her again .\n\" I 'll have them nicely dried , sir , at once , \" she said , and carried his clothes out of the room .\nShe glanced at his white-swathed head and blue goggles again as she was going out of the door ; but his napkin was still in front of his face .\nShe shivered a little as she closed the door behind her , and her face was eloquent of her surprise and perplexity .\n\" I _ never _ , \" she whispered .\n\" There ! \"\nShe went quite softly to the kitchen , and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was messing about with _ now _ , when she got there .\nThe visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet .\nHe glanced inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette , and resumed his meal .\nHe took a mouthful , glanced suspiciously at the window , took another mouthful , then rose and , taking the serviette in his hand , walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the white muslin that obscured the lower panes .\nThis left the room in a twilight .\nThis done , he returned with an easier air to the table and his meal .\n\" The poor soul 's had an accident or an op ' ration or somethin' , \" said Mrs. Hall .\n\" What a turn them bandages did give me , to be sure ! \"\nShe put on some more coal , unfolded the clothes-horse , and extended the traveller 's coat upon this .\n\" And they goggles !\nWhy , he looked more like a divin ' helmet than a human man ! \"\nShe hung his muffler on a corner of the horse .\n\" And holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time .\nTalkin ' through it !\n... Perhaps his mouth was hurt too -- maybe . \"\nShe turned round , as one who suddenly remembers .\n\" Bless my soul alive ! \" she said , going off at a tangent ; \" ai n't you done them taters _ yet _ , Millie ? \"\nWhen Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger 's lunch , her idea that his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she supposed him to have suffered , was confirmed , for he was smoking a pipe , and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the mouthpiece to his lips .\nYet it was not forgetfulness , for she saw he glanced at it as it smouldered out .\nHe sat in the corner with his back to the window-blind and spoke now , having eaten and drunk and being comfortably warmed through , with less aggressive brevity than before .\nThe reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big spectacles they had lacked hitherto .\n\" I have some luggage , \" he said , \" at Bramblehurst station , \" and he asked her how he could have it sent .\nHe bowed his bandaged head quite politely in acknowledgment of her explanation .\n\" To-morrow ? \" he said .\n\" There is no speedier delivery ? \" and seemed quite disappointed when she answered , \" No . \"\nWas she quite sure ?\nNo man with a trap who would go over ?\nMrs. Hall , nothing loath , answered his questions and developed a conversation .\n\" It 's a steep road by the down , sir , \" she said in answer to the question about a trap ; and then , snatching at an opening , said , \" It was there a carriage was upsettled , a year ago and more .\nA gentleman killed , besides his coachman .\nAccidents , sir , happen in a moment , do n't they ? \"\nBut the visitor was not to be drawn so easily .\n\" They do , \" he said through his muffler , eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable glasses .\n",

    "Part I 01 My Early Home The first place that I can well remember was a large pleasant meadow with a pond of clear water in it .\nSome shady trees leaned over it , and rushes and water-lilies grew at the deep end .\nOver the hedge on one side we looked into a plowed field , and on the other we looked over a gate at our master ’s house , which stood by the roadside ; at the top of the meadow was a grove of fir trees , and at the bottom a running brook overhung by a steep bank .\nWhile I was young I lived upon my mother ’s milk , as I could not eat grass .\nIn the daytime I ran by her side , and at night I lay down close by her .\nWhen it was hot we used to stand by the pond in the shade of the trees , and when it was cold we had a nice warm shed near the grove .\nAs soon as I was old enough to eat grass my mother used to go out to work in the daytime , and come back in the evening .\nThere were six young colts in the meadow besides me ; they were older than I was ; some were nearly as large as grown-up horses .\nI used to run with them , and had great fun ; we used to gallop all together round and round the field as hard as we could go .\nSometimes we had rather rough play , for they would frequently bite and kick as well as gallop .\nOne day , when there was a good deal of kicking , my mother whinnied to me to come to her , and then she said : “ I wish you to pay attention to what I am going to say to you .\nThe colts who live here are very good colts , but they are cart-horse colts , and of course they have not learned manners .\nYou have been well-bred and well-born ; your father has a great name in these parts , and your grandfather won the cup two years at the Newmarket races ; your grandmother had the sweetest temper of any horse I ever knew , and I think you have never seen me kick or bite .\nI hope you will grow up gentle and good , and never learn bad ways ; do your work with a good will , lift your feet up well when you trot , and never bite or kick even in play . ”\nI have never forgotten my mother ’s advice ; I knew she was a wise old horse , and our master thought a great deal of her .\nHer name was Duchess , but he often called her Pet .\nOur master was a good , kind man .\nHe gave us good food , good lodging , and kind words ; he spoke as kindly to us as he did to his little children .\nWe were all fond of him , and my mother loved him very much .\nWhen she saw him at the gate she would neigh with joy , and trot up to him .\nHe would pat and stroke her and say , “ Well , old Pet , and how is your little Darkie ? ”\nI was a dull black , so he called me Darkie ; then he would give me a piece of bread , which was very good , and sometimes he brought a carrot for my mother .\nAll the horses would come to him , but I think we were his favorites .\nMy mother always took him to the town on a market day in a light gig .\nThere was a plowboy , Dick , who sometimes came into our field to pluck blackberries from the hedge .\nWhen he had eaten all he wanted he would have what he called fun with the colts , throwing stones and sticks at them to make them gallop .\nWe did not much mind him , for we could gallop off ; but sometimes a stone would hit and hurt us .\nOne day he was at this game , and did not know that the master was in the next field ; but he was there , watching what was going on ; over the hedge he jumped in a snap , and catching Dick by the arm , he gave him such a box on the ear as made him roar with the pain and surprise .\nAs soon as we saw the master we trotted up nearer to see what went on .\n“ Bad boy ! ” he said , “ bad boy !\nto chase the colts .\nThis is not the first time , nor the second , but it shall be the last .\nThere -- take your money and go home ; I shall not want you on my farm again . ”\nSo we never saw Dick any more .\nOld Daniel , the man who looked after the horses , was just as gentle as our master , so we were well off .\n02 The Hunt Before I was two years old a circumstance happened which I have never forgotten .\nIt was early in the spring ; there had been a little frost in the night , and a light mist still hung over the woods and meadows .\nI and the other colts were feeding at the lower part of the field when we heard , quite in the distance , what sounded like the cry of dogs .\nThe oldest of the colts raised his head , pricked his ears , and said , “ There are the hounds ! ” and immediately cantered off , followed by the rest of us to the upper part of the field , where we could look over the hedge and see several fields beyond .\nMy mother and an old riding horse of our master ’s were also standing near , and seemed to know all about it .\n“ They have found a hare , ” said my mother , “ and if they come this way we shall see the hunt . ”\nAnd soon the dogs were all tearing down the field of young wheat next to ours .\nI never heard such a noise as they made .\nThey did not bark , nor howl , nor whine , but kept on a “ yo !\nyo , o , o !\nyo !\nyo , o , o ! ” at the top of their voices .\nAfter them came a number of men on horseback , some of them in green coats , all galloping as fast as they could .\nThe old horse snorted and looked eagerly after them , and we young colts wanted to be galloping with them , but they were soon away into the fields lower down ; here it seemed as if they had come to a stand ; the dogs left off barking , and ran about every way with their noses to the ground .\n“ They have lost the scent , ” said the old horse ; “ perhaps the hare will get off . ”\n“ What hare ? ”\nI said .\n“ Oh !\nI do n’t know what hare ; likely enough it may be one of our own hares out of the woods ; any hare they can find will do for the dogs and men to run after ; ” and before long the dogs began their “ yo !\nyo , o , o ! ” again , and back they came altogether at full speed , making straight for our meadow at the part where the high bank and hedge overhang the brook .\n“ Now we shall see the hare , ” said my mother ; and just then a hare wild with fright rushed by and made for the woods .\nOn came the dogs ; they burst over the bank , leaped the stream , and came dashing across the field followed by the huntsmen .\nSix or eight men leaped their horses clean over , close upon the dogs .\nThe hare tried to get through the fence ; it was too thick , and she turned sharp round to make for the road , but it was too late ; the dogs were upon her with their wild cries ; we heard one shriek , and that was the end of her .\nOne of the huntsmen rode up and whipped off the dogs , who would soon have torn her to pieces .\nHe held her up by the leg torn and bleeding , and all the gentlemen seemed well pleased .\nAs for me , I was so astonished that I did not at first see what was going on by the brook ; but when I did look there was a sad sight ; two fine horses were down , one was struggling in the stream , and the other was groaning on the grass .\nOne of the riders was getting out of the water covered with mud , the other lay quite still .\n“ His neck is broke , ” said my mother .\n“ And serve him right , too , ” said one of the colts .\nI thought the same , but my mother did not join with us .\n“ Well , no , ” she said , “ you must not say that ; but though I am an old horse , and have seen and heard a great deal , I never yet could make out why men are so fond of this sport ; they often hurt themselves , often spoil good horses , and tear up the fields , and all for a hare or a fox , or a stag , that they could get more easily some other way ; but we are only horses , and do n’t know . ”\nWhile my mother was saying this we stood and looked on .\nMany of the riders had gone to the young man ; but my master , who had been watching what was going on , was the first to raise him .\nHis head fell back and his arms hung down , and every one looked very serious .\nThere was no noise now ; even the dogs were quiet , and seemed to know that something was wrong .\nThey carried him to our master ’s house .\nI heard afterward that it was young George Gordon , the squire ’s only son , a fine , tall young man , and the pride of his family .\nThere was now riding off in all directions to the doctor ’s , to the farrier ’s , and no doubt to Squire Gordon ’s , to let him know about his son .\nWhen Mr. Bond , the farrier , came to look at the black horse that lay groaning on the grass , he felt him all over , and shook his head ; one of his legs was broken .\nThen some one ran to our master ’s house and came back with a gun ; presently there was a loud bang and a dreadful shriek , and then all was still ; the black horse moved no more .\nMy mother seemed much troubled ; she said she had known that horse for years , and that his name was “ Rob Roy ” ; he was a good horse , and there was no vice in him .\nShe never would go to that part of the field afterward .\n",

    "THE SISTERS There was no hope for him this time : it was the third stroke .\nNight after night I had passed the house ( it was vacation time ) and studied the lighted square of window : and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way , faintly and evenly .\nIf he was dead , I thought , I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse .\nHe had often said to me : “ I am not long for this world , ” and I had thought his words idle .\nNow I knew they were true .\nEvery night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis .\nIt had always sounded strangely in my ears , like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism .\nBut now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being .\nIt filled me with fear , and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work .\nOld Cotter was sitting at the fire , smoking , when I came downstairs to supper .\nWhile my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said , as if returning to some former remark of his : “ No , I would n’t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer ... there was something uncanny about him .\nI ’ll tell you my opinion .... ” He began to puff at his pipe , no doubt arranging his opinion in his mind .\nTiresome old fool !\nWhen we knew him first he used to be rather interesting , talking of faints and worms ; but I soon grew tired of him and his endless stories about the distillery .\n“ I have my own theory about it , ” he said .\n“ I think it was one of those ... peculiar cases ... .\nBut it ’s hard to say .... ” He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory .\nMy uncle saw me staring and said to me : “ Well , so your old friend is gone , you ’ll be sorry to hear . ”\n“ Who ? ”\nsaid I. “ Father Flynn . ”\n“ Is he dead ? ”\n“ Mr Cotter here has just told us .\nHe was passing by the house . ”\nI knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the news had not interested me .\nMy uncle explained to old Cotter .\n“ The youngster and he were great friends .\nThe old chap taught him a great deal , mind you ; and they say he had a great wish for him . ”\n“ God have mercy on his soul , ” said my aunt piously .\nOld Cotter looked at me for a while .\nI felt that his little beady black eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from my plate .\nHe returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate .\n“ I would n’t like children of mine , ” he said , “ to have too much to say to a man like that . ”\n“ How do you mean , Mr Cotter ? ”\nasked my aunt .\n“ What I mean is , ” said old Cotter , “ it ’s bad for children .\nMy idea is : let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and not be ... .\nAm I right , Jack ? ”\n“ That ’s my principle , too , ” said my uncle .\n“ Let him learn to box his corner .\nThat ’s what I ’m always saying to that Rosicrucian there : take exercise .\nWhy , when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a cold bath , winter and summer .\nAnd that ’s what stands to me now .\nEducation is all very fine and large ... .\nMr Cotter might take a pick of that leg mutton , ” he added to my aunt .\n“ No , no , not for me , ” said old Cotter .\nMy aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table .\n“ But why do you think it ’s not good for children , Mr Cotter ? ”\nshe asked .\n“ It ’s bad for children , ” said old Cotter , “ because their minds are so impressionable .\nWhen children see things like that , you know , it has an effect .... ” I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my anger .\nTiresome old red-nosed imbecile !\nIt was late when I fell asleep .\nThough I was angry with old Cotter for alluding to me as a child , I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his unfinished sentences .\nIn the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic .\nI drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas .\nBut the grey face still followed me .\nIt murmured ; and I understood that it desired to confess something .\nI felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region ; and there again I found it waiting for me .\nIt began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle .\nBut then I remembered that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin .\nThe next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little house in Great Britain Street .\nIt was an unassuming shop , registered under the vague name of Drapery .\nThe drapery consisted mainly of children ’s bootees and umbrellas ; and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the window , saying : Umbrellas Re-covered .\nNo notice was visible now for the shutters were up .\nA crape bouquet was tied to the door-knocker with ribbon .\nTwo poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape .\nI also approached and read : July 1st , 1895 The Rev. James Flynn ( formerly of S. Catherine ’s Church , Meath Street ) , aged sixty-five years .\nR. I. P .\nThe reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was disturbed to find myself at check .\nHad he not been dead I would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in his arm-chair by the fire , nearly smothered in his great-coat .\nPerhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this present would have roused him from his stupefied doze .\nIt was always I who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor .\nEven as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of his coat .\nIt may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief , blackened , as it always was , with the snuff-stains of a week , with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains , was quite inefficacious .\nI wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock .\nI walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street , reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shop-windows as I went .\nI found it strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been freed from something by his death .\nI wondered at this for , as my uncle had said the night before , he had taught me a great deal .\nHe had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce Latin properly .\nHe had told me stories about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte , and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest .\nSometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me , asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections .\nHis questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as the simplest acts .\nThe duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them ; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the Church had written books as thick as the Post Office Directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper , elucidating all these intricate questions .\nOften when I thought of this I could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice .\nSometimes he used to put me through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart ; and , as I pattered , he used to smile pensively and nod his head , now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately .\nWhen he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip — a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well .\nAs I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter ’s words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream .\nI remembered that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion .\nI felt that I had been very far away , in some land where the customs were strange — in Persia , I thought ... .\nBut I could not remember the end of the dream .\nIn the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning .\nIt was after sunset ; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds .\nNannie received us in the hall ; and , as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her , my aunt shook hands with her for all .\nThe old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and , on my aunt ’s nodding , proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us , her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banister-rail .\nAt the first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the dead-room .\nMy aunt went in and the old woman , seeing that I hesitated to enter , began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand .\n",

    "THE TURN OF THE SCREW The story had held us , round the fire , sufficiently breathless , but except the obvious remark that it was gruesome , as , on Christmas Eve in an old house , a strange tale should essentially be , I remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child .\nThe case , I may mention , was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had gathered us for the occasion -- an appearance , of a dreadful kind , to a little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the terror of it ; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to sleep again , but to encounter also , herself , before she had succeeded in doing so , the same sight that had shaken him .\nIt was this observation that drew from Douglas -- not immediately , but later in the evening -- a reply that had the interesting consequence to which I call attention .\nSomeone else told a story not particularly effective , which I saw he was not following .\nThis I took for a sign that he had himself something to produce and that we should only have to wait .\nWe waited in fact till two nights later ; but that same evening , before we scattered , he brought out what was in his mind .\n“ I quite agree -- in regard to Griffin ’s ghost , or whatever it was -- that its appearing first to the little boy , at so tender an age , adds a particular touch .\nBut it ’s not the first occurrence of its charming kind that I know to have involved a child .\nIf the child gives the effect another turn of the screw , what do you say to TWO children -- ? ”\n“ We say , of course , ” somebody exclaimed , “ that they give two turns !\nAlso that we want to hear about them . ”\nI can see Douglas there before the fire , to which he had got up to present his back , looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in his pockets .\n“ Nobody but me , till now , has ever heard .\nIt ’s quite too horrible . ”\nThis , naturally , was declared by several voices to give the thing the utmost price , and our friend , with quiet art , prepared his triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on : “ It ’s beyond everything .\nNothing at all that I know touches it . ”\n“ For sheer terror ? ”\nI remember asking .\nHe seemed to say it was not so simple as that ; to be really at a loss how to qualify it .\nHe passed his hand over his eyes , made a little wincing grimace .\n“ For dreadful -- dreadfulness ! ”\n“ Oh , how delicious ! ”\ncried one of the women .\nHe took no notice of her ; he looked at me , but as if , instead of me , he saw what he spoke of .\n“ For general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain . ”\n“ Well then , ” I said , “ just sit right down and begin . ”\nHe turned round to the fire , gave a kick to a log , watched it an instant .\nThen as he faced us again : “ I ca n’t begin .\nI shall have to send to town . ”\nThere was a unanimous groan at this , and much reproach ; after which , in his preoccupied way , he explained .\n“ The story ’s written .\nIt ’s in a locked drawer -- it has not been out for years .\nI could write to my man and enclose the key ; he could send down the packet as he finds it . ”\nIt was to me in particular that he appeared to propound this -- appeared almost to appeal for aid not to hesitate .\nHe had broken a thickness of ice , the formation of many a winter ; had had his reasons for a long silence .\nThe others resented postponement , but it was just his scruples that charmed me .\nI adjured him to write by the first post and to agree with us for an early hearing ; then I asked him if the experience in question had been his own .\nTo this his answer was prompt .\n“ Oh , thank God , no ! ”\n“ And is the record yours ?\nYou took the thing down ? ”\n“ Nothing but the impression .\nI took that HERE ” -- he tapped his heart .\n“ I ’ve never lost it . ”\n“ Then your manuscript -- ? ”\n“ Is in old , faded ink , and in the most beautiful hand . ”\nHe hung fire again .\n“ A woman ’s .\nShe has been dead these twenty years .\nShe sent me the pages in question before she died . ”\nThey were all listening now , and of course there was somebody to be arch , or at any rate to draw the inference .\nBut if he put the inference by without a smile it was also without irritation .\n“ She was a most charming person , but she was ten years older than I .\nShe was my sister ’s governess , ” he quietly said .\n“ She was the most agreeable woman I ’ve ever known in her position ; she would have been worthy of any whatever .\nIt was long ago , and this episode was long before .\nI was at Trinity , and I found her at home on my coming down the second summer .\nI was much there that year -- it was a beautiful one ; and we had , in her off-hours , some strolls and talks in the garden -- talks in which she struck me as awfully clever and nice .\nOh yes ; do n’t grin : I liked her extremely and am glad to this day to think she liked me , too .\nIf she had n’t she would n’t have told me .\nShe had never told anyone .\nIt was n’t simply that she said so , but that I knew she had n’t .\nI was sure ; I could see .\nYou ’ll easily judge why when you hear . ”\n“ Because the thing had been such a scare ? ”\nHe continued to fix me .\n“ You ’ll easily judge , ” he repeated : “ YOU will . ”\nI fixed him , too .\n“ I see .\nShe was in love . ”\nHe laughed for the first time .\n“ You ARE acute .\nYes , she was in love .\nThat is , she had been .\nThat came out -- she could n’t tell her story without its coming out .\nI saw it , and she saw I saw it ; but neither of us spoke of it .\nI remember the time and the place -- the corner of the lawn , the shade of the great beeches and the long , hot summer afternoon .\nIt was n’t a scene for a shudder ; but oh -- ! ”\nHe quitted the fire and dropped back into his chair .\n“ You ’ll receive the packet Thursday morning ? ”\nI inquired .\n“ Probably not till the second post . ”\n“ Well then ; after dinner -- ” “ You ’ll all meet me here ? ”\nHe looked us round again .\n“ Is n’t anybody going ? ”\nIt was almost the tone of hope .\n“ Everybody will stay ! ”\n“ _ I _ will ” -- and “ _ I _ will ! ”\ncried the ladies whose departure had been fixed .\nMrs. Griffin , however , expressed the need for a little more light .\n“ Who was it she was in love with ? ”\n“ The story will tell , ” I took upon myself to reply .\n“ Oh , I ca n’t wait for the story ! ”\n“ The story WO N’T tell , ” said Douglas ; “ not in any literal , vulgar way . ”\n“ More ’s the pity , then .\nThat ’s the only way I ever understand . ”\n“ Wo n’t YOU tell , Douglas ? ”\nsomebody else inquired .\nHe sprang to his feet again .\n“ Yes -- tomorrow .\nNow I must go to bed .\nGood night . ”\nAnd quickly catching up a candlestick , he left us slightly bewildered .\nFrom our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on the stair ; whereupon Mrs. Griffin spoke .\n“ Well , if I do n’t know who she was in love with , I know who HE was . ”\n“ She was ten years older , ” said her husband .\n“ Raison de plus -- at that age !\nBut it ’s rather nice , his long reticence . ”\n“ Forty years ! ”\nGriffin put in .\n“ With this outbreak at last . ”\n“ The outbreak , ” I returned , “ will make a tremendous occasion of Thursday night ; ” and everyone so agreed with me that , in the light of it , we lost all attention for everything else .\nThe last story , however incomplete and like the mere opening of a serial , had been told ; we handshook and “ candlestuck , ” as somebody said , and went to bed .\nI knew the next day that a letter containing the key had , by the first post , gone off to his London apartments ; but in spite of -- or perhaps just on account of -- the eventual diffusion of this knowledge we quite let him alone till after dinner , till such an hour of the evening , in fact , as might best accord with the kind of emotion on which our hopes were fixed .\nThen he became as communicative as we could desire and indeed gave us his best reason for being so .\nWe had it from him again before the fire in the hall , as we had had our mild wonders of the previous night .\nIt appeared that the narrative he had promised to read us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue .\nLet me say here distinctly , to have done with it , that this narrative , from an exact transcript of my own made much later , is what I shall presently give .\nPoor Douglas , before his death -- when it was in sight -- committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of these days and that , on the same spot , with immense effect , he began to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth .\nThe departing ladies who had said they would stay did n’t , of course , thank heaven , stay : they departed , in consequence of arrangements made , in a rage of curiosity , as they professed , produced by the touches with which he had already worked us up .\nBut that only made his little final auditory more compact and select , kept it , round the hearth , subject to a common thrill .\n",

    "VOLUME I CHAPTER I .\nA BOARDING SCHOOL .\n“ ARE you for a walk , ” said Montraville to his companion , as they arose from table ; “ are you for a walk ?\nor shall we order the chaise and proceed to Portsmouth ? ”\nBelcour preferred the former ; and they sauntered out to view the town , and to make remarks on the inhabitants , as they returned from church .\nMontraville was a Lieutenant in the army : Belcour was his brother officer : they had been to take leave of their friends previous to their departure for America , and were now returning to Portsmouth , where the troops waited orders for embarkation .\nThey had stopped at Chichester to dine ; and knowing they had sufficient time to reach the place of destination before dark , and yet allow them a walk , had resolved , it being Sunday afternoon , to take a survey of the Chichester ladies as they returned from their devotions .\nThey had gratified their curiosity , and were preparing to return to the inn without honouring any of the belles with particular notice , when Madame Du Pont , at the head of her school , descended from the church .\nSuch an assemblage of youth and innocence naturally attracted the young soldiers : they stopped ; and , as the little cavalcade passed , almost involuntarily pulled off their hats .\nA tall , elegant girl looked at Montraville and blushed : he instantly recollected the features of Charlotte Temple , whom he had once seen and danced with at a ball at Portsmouth .\nAt that time he thought on her only as a very lovely child , she being then only thirteen ; but the improvement two years had made in her person , and the blush of recollection which suffused her cheeks as she passed , awakened in his bosom new and pleasing ideas .\nVanity led him to think that pleasure at again beholding him might have occasioned the emotion he had witnessed , and the same vanity led him to wish to see her again .\n“ She is the sweetest girl in the world , ” said he , as he entered the inn .\nBelcour stared .\n“ Did you not notice her ? ” continued Montraville : “ she had on a blue bonnet , and with a pair of lovely eyes of the same colour , has contrived to make me feel devilish odd about the heart . ”\n“ Pho , ” said Belcour , “ a musket ball from our friends , the Americans , may in less than two months make you feel worse . ”\n“ I never think of the future , ” replied Montraville ; “ but am determined to make the most of the present , and would willingly compound with any kind Familiar who would inform me who the girl is , and how I might be likely to obtain an interview . ”\nBut no kind Familiar at that time appearing , and the chaise which they had ordered , driving up to the door , Montraville and his companion were obliged to take leave of Chichester and its fair inhabitant , and proceed on their journey .\nBut Charlotte had made too great an impression on his mind to be easily eradicated : having therefore spent three whole days in thinking on her and in endeavouring to form some plan for seeing her , he determined to set off for Chichester , and trust to chance either to favour or frustrate his designs .\nArriving at the verge of the town , he dismounted , and sending the servant forward with the horses , proceeded toward the place , where , in the midst of an extensive pleasure ground , stood the mansion which contained the lovely Charlotte Temple .\nMontraville leaned on a broken gate , and looked earnestly at the house .\nThe wall which surrounded it was high , and perhaps the Argus ’s who guarded the Hesperian fruit within , were more watchful than those famed of old .\n“‘ Tis a romantic attempt , ” said he ; “ and should I even succeed in seeing and conversing with her , it can be productive of no good : I must of necessity leave England in a few days , and probably may never return ; why then should I endeavour to engage the affections of this lovely girl , only to leave her a prey to a thousand inquietudes , of which at present she has no idea ?\nI will return to Portsmouth and think no more about her . ”\nThe evening now was closed ; a serene stillness reigned ; and the chaste Queen of Night with her silver crescent faintly illuminated the hemisphere .\nThe mind of Montraville was hushed into composure by the serenity of the surrounding objects .\n“ I will think on her no more , ” said he , and turned with an intention to leave the place ; but as he turned , he saw the gate which led to the pleasure grounds open , and two women come out , who walked arm-in-arm across the field .\n“ I will at least see who these are , ” said he .\nHe overtook them , and giving them the compliments of the evening , begged leave to see them into the more frequented parts of the town : but how was he delighted , when , waiting for an answer , he discovered , under the concealment of a large bonnet , the face of Charlotte Temple .\nHe soon found means to ingratiate himself with her companion , who was a French teacher at the school , and , at parting , slipped a letter he had purposely written , into Charlotte ’s hand , and five guineas into that of Mademoiselle , who promised she would endeavour to bring her young charge into the field again the next evening .\nCHAPTER II .\nDOMESTIC CONCERNS .\nMR. Temple was the youngest son of a nobleman whose fortune was by no means adequate to the antiquity , grandeur , and I may add , pride of the family .\nHe saw his elder brother made completely wretched by marrying a disagreeable woman , whose fortune helped to prop the sinking dignity of the house ; and he beheld his sisters legally prostituted to old , decrepid men , whose titles gave them consequence in the eyes of the world , and whose affluence rendered them splendidly miserable .\n“ I will not sacrifice internal happiness for outward shew , ” said he : “ I will seek Content ; and , if I find her in a cottage , will embrace her with as much cordiality as I should if seated on a throne . ”\nMr. Temple possessed a small estate of about five hundred pounds a year ; and with that he resolved to preserve independence , to marry where the feelings of his heart should direct him , and to confine his expenses within the limits of his income .\nHe had a heart open to every generous feeling of humanity , and a hand ready to dispense to those who wanted part of the blessings he enjoyed himself .\nAs he was universally known to be the friend of the unfortunate , his advice and bounty was frequently solicited ; nor was it seldom that he sought out indigent merit , and raised it from obscurity , confining his own expenses within a very narrow compass .\n“ You are a benevolent fellow , ” said a young officer to him one day ; “ and I have a great mind to give you a fine subject to exercise the goodness of your heart upon . ”\n“ You can not oblige me more , ” said Temple , “ than to point out any way by which I can be serviceable to my fellow creatures . ”\n“ Come along then , ” said the young man , “ we will go and visit a man who is not in so good a lodging as he deserves ; and , were it not that he has an angel with him , who comforts and supports him , he must long since have sunk under his misfortunes . ”\nThe young man ’s heart was too full to proceed ; and Temple , unwilling to irritate his feelings by making further enquiries , followed him in silence , til they arrived at the Fleet prison .\nThe officer enquired for Captain Eldridge : a person led them up several pair of dirty stairs , and pointing to a door which led to a miserable , small apartment , said that was the Captain ’s room , and retired .\nThe officer , whose name was Blakeney , tapped at the door , and was bid to enter by a voice melodiously soft .\nHe opened the door , and discovered to Temple a scene which rivetted him to the spot with astonishment .\nThe apartment , though small , and bearing strong marks of poverty , was neat in the extreme .\nIn an arm-chair , his head reclined upon his hand , his eyes fixed on a book which lay open before him , sat an aged man in a Lieutenant ’s uniform , which , though threadbare , would sooner call a blush of shame into the face of those who could neglect real merit , than cause the hectic of confusion to glow on the cheeks of him who wore it .\nBeside him sat a lovely creature busied in painting a fan mount .\nShe was fair as the lily , but sorrow had nipped the rose in her cheek before it was half blown .\nHer eyes were blue ; and her hair , which was light brown , was slightly confined under a plain muslin cap , tied round with a black ribbon ; a white linen gown and plain lawn handkerchief composed the remainder of her dress ; and in this simple attire , she was more irresistibly charming to such a heart as Temple ’s , than she would have been , if adorned with all the splendor of a courtly belle .\nWhen they entered , the old man arose from his seat , and shaking Blakeney by the hand with great cordiality , offered Temple his chair ; and there being but three in the room , seated himself on the side of his little bed with evident composure .\n“ This is a strange place , ” said he to Temple , “ to receive visitors of distinction in ; but we must fit our feelings to our station .\nWhile I am not ashamed to own the cause which brought me here , why should I blush at my situation ?\nOur misfortunes are not our faults ; and were it not for that poor girl -- ” Here the philosopher was lost in the father .\nHe rose hastily from his seat , and walking toward the window , wiped off a tear which he was afraid would tarnish the cheek of a sailor .\nTemple cast his eye on Miss Eldridge : a pellucid drop had stolen from her eyes , and fallen upon a rose she was painting .\nIt blotted and discoloured the flower .\n“‘ Tis emblematic , ” said he mentally : “ the rose of youth and health soon fades when watered by the tear of affliction . ”\n“ My friend Blakeney , ” said he , addressing the old man , “ told me I could be of service to you : be so kind then , dear Sir , as to point out some way in which I can relieve the anxiety of your heart and increase the pleasures of my own . ”\n",

    "BOOK I. CONTAINING AS MUCH OF THE BIRTH OF THE FOUNDLING AS IS NECESSARY OR PROPER TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY .\nChapter i .\nThe introduction to the work , or bill of fare to the feast .\nAn author ought to consider himself , not as a gentleman who gives a private or eleemosynary treat , but rather as one who keeps a public ordinary , at which all persons are welcome for their money .\nIn the former case , it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare he pleases ; and though this should be very indifferent , and utterly disagreeable to the taste of his company , they must not find any fault ; nay , on the contrary , good breeding forces them outwardly to approve and to commend whatever is set before them .\nNow the contrary of this happens to the master of an ordinary .\nMen who pay for what they eat will insist on gratifying their palates , however nice and whimsical these may prove ; and if everything is not agreeable to their taste , will challenge a right to censure , to abuse , and to d -- n their dinner without controul .\nTo prevent , therefore , giving offence to their customers by any such disappointment , it hath been usual with the honest and well-meaning host to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their first entrance into the house ; and having thence acquainted themselves with the entertainment which they may expect , may either stay and regale with what is provided for them , or may depart to some other ordinary better accommodated to their taste .\nAs we do not disdain to borrow wit or wisdom from any man who is capable of lending us either , we have condescended to take a hint from these honest victuallers , and shall prefix not only a general bill of fare to our whole entertainment , but shall likewise give the reader particular bills to every course which is to be served up in this and the ensuing volumes .\nThe provision , then , which we have here made is no other than _ Human Nature _ .\nNor do I fear that my sensible reader , though most luxurious in his taste , will start , cavil , or be offended , because I have named but one article .\nThe tortoise -- as the alderman of Bristol , well learned in eating , knows by much experience -- besides the delicious calipash and calipee , contains many different kinds of food ; nor can the learned reader be ignorant , that in human nature , though here collected under one general name , is such prodigious variety , that a cook will have sooner gone through all the several species of animal and vegetable food in the world , than an author will be able to exhaust so extensive a subject .\nAn objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate , that this dish is too common and vulgar ; for what else is the subject of all the romances , novels , plays , and poems , with which the stalls abound ?\nMany exquisite viands might be rejected by the epicure , if it was a sufficient cause for his contemning of them as common and vulgar , that something was to be found in the most paltry alleys under the same name .\nIn reality , true nature is as difficult to be met with in authors , as the Bayonne ham , or Bologna sausage , is to be found in the shops .\nBut the whole , to continue the same metaphor , consists in the cookery of the author ; for , as Mr Pope tells us -- “ True wit is nature to advantage drest ; What oft was thought , but ne'er so well exprest . ”\nThe same animal which hath the honour to have some part of his flesh eaten at the table of a duke , may perhaps be degraded in another part , and some of his limbs gibbeted , as it were , in the vilest stall in town .\nWhere , then , lies the difference between the food of the nobleman and the porter , if both are at dinner on the same ox or calf , but in the seasoning , the dressing , the garnishing , and the setting forth ?\nHence the one provokes and incites the most languid appetite , and the other turns and palls that which is the sharpest and keenest .\nIn like manner , the excellence of the mental entertainment consists less in the subject than in the author 's skill in well dressing it up .\nHow pleased , therefore , will the reader be to find that we have , in the following work , adhered closely to one of the highest principles of the best cook which the present age , or perhaps that of Heliogabalus , hath produced .\nThis great man , as is well known to all lovers of polite eating , begins at first by setting plain things before his hungry guests , rising afterwards by degrees as their stomachs may be supposed to decrease , to the very quintessence of sauce and spices .\nIn like manner , we shall represent human nature at first to the keen appetite of our reader , in that more plain and simple manner in which it is found in the country , and shall hereafter hash and ragoo it with all the high French and Italian seasoning of affectation and vice which courts and cities afford .\nBy these means , we doubt not but our reader may be rendered desirous to read on for ever , as the great person just above-mentioned is supposed to have made some persons eat .\nHaving premised thus much , we will now detain those who like our bill of fare no longer from their diet , and shall proceed directly to serve up the first course of our history for their entertainment .\nChapter ii .\nA short description of squire Allworthy , and a fuller account of Miss Bridget Allworthy , his sister .\nIn that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly called Somersetshire , there lately lived , and perhaps lives still , a gentleman whose name was Allworthy , and who might well be called the favourite of both nature and fortune ; for both of these seem to have contended which should bless and enrich him most .\nIn this contention , nature may seem to some to have come off victorious , as she bestowed on him many gifts , while fortune had only one gift in her power ; but in pouring forth this , she was so very profuse , that others perhaps may think this single endowment to have been more than equivalent to all the various blessings which he enjoyed from nature .\nFrom the former of these , he derived an agreeable person , a sound constitution , a solid understanding , and a benevolent heart ; by the latter , he was decreed to the inheritance of one of the largest estates in the county .\nThis gentleman had in his youth married a very worthy and beautiful woman , of whom he had been extremely fond : by her he had three children , all of whom died in their infancy .\nHe had likewise had the misfortune of burying this beloved wife herself , about five years before the time in which this history chuses to set out .\nThis loss , however great , he bore like a man of sense and constancy , though it must be confest he would often talk a little whimsically on this head ; for he sometimes said he looked on himself as still married , and considered his wife as only gone a little before him , a journey which he should most certainly , sooner or later , take after her ; and that he had not the least doubt of meeting her again in a place where he should never part with her more -- sentiments for which his sense was arraigned by one part of his neighbours , his religion by a second , and his sincerity by a third .\nHe now lived , for the most part , retired in the country , with one sister , for whom he had a very tender affection .\nThis lady was now somewhat past the age of thirty , an aera at which , in the opinion of the malicious , the title of old maid may with no impropriety be assumed .\nShe was of that species of women whom you commend rather for good qualities than beauty , and who are generally called , by their own sex , very good sort of women -- as good a sort of woman , madam , as you would wish to know .\nIndeed , she was so far from regretting want of beauty , that she never mentioned that perfection , if it can be called one , without contempt ; and would often thank God she was not as handsome as Miss Such-a-one , whom perhaps beauty had led into errors which she might have otherwise avoided .\nMiss Bridget Allworthy ( for that was the name of this lady ) very rightly conceived the charms of person in a woman to be no better than snares for herself , as well as for others ; and yet so discreet was she in her conduct , that her prudence was as much on the guard as if she had all the snares to apprehend which were ever laid for her whole sex .\nIndeed , I have observed , though it may seem unaccountable to the reader , that this guard of prudence , like the trained bands , is always readiest to go on duty where there is the least danger .\nIt often basely and cowardly deserts those paragons for whom the men are all wishing , sighing , dying , and spreading every net in their power ; and constantly attends at the heels of that higher order of women for whom the other sex have a more distant and awful respect , and whom ( from despair , I suppose , of success ) they never venture to attack .\nReader , I think proper , before we proceed any farther together , to acquaint thee that I intend to digress , through this whole history , as often as I see occasion , of which I am myself a better judge than any pitiful critic whatever ; and here I must desire all those critics to mind their own business , and not to intermeddle with affairs or works which no ways concern them ; for till they produce the authority by which they are constituted judges , I shall not plead to their jurisdiction .\nChapter iii .\nAn odd accident which befel Mr Allworthy at his return home .\nThe decent behaviour of Mrs Deborah Wilkins , with some proper animadversions on bastards .\nI have told my reader , in the preceding chapter , that Mr Allworthy inherited a large fortune ; that he had a good heart , and no family .\nHence , doubtless , it will be concluded by many that he lived like an honest man , owed no one a shilling , took nothing but what was his own , kept a good house , entertained his neighbours with a hearty welcome at his table , and was charitable to the poor , i.e. to those who had rather beg than work , by giving them the offals from it ; that he died immensely rich and built an hospital .\n",

    "PROLOGUE I A FACE haunted Cameron -- a woman 's face .\nIt was there in the white heart of the dying campfire ; it hung in the shadows that hovered over the flickering light ; it drifted in the darkness beyond .\nThis hour , when the day had closed and the lonely desert night set in with its dead silence , was one in which Cameron 's mind was thronged with memories of a time long past -- of a home back in Peoria , of a woman he had wronged and lost , and loved too late .\nHe was a prospector for gold , a hunter of solitude , a lover of the drear , rock-ribbed infinitude , because he wanted to be alone to remember .\nA sound disturbed Cameron 's reflections .\nHe bent his head listening .\nA soft wind fanned the paling embers , blew sparks and white ashes and thin smoke away into the enshrouding circle of blackness .\nHis burro did not appear to be moving about .\nThe quiet split to the cry of a coyote .\nIt rose strange , wild , mournful -- not the howl of a prowling upland beast baying the campfire or barking at a lonely prospector , but the wail of a wolf , full-voiced , crying out the meaning of the desert and the night .\nHunger throbbed in it -- hunger for a mate , for offspring , for life .\nWhen it ceased , the terrible desert silence smote Cameron , and the cry echoed in his soul .\nHe and that wandering wolf were brothers .\nThen a sharp clink of metal on stone and soft pads of hoofs in sand prompted Cameron to reach for his gun , and to move out of the light of the waning campfire .\nHe was somewhere along the wild border line between Sonora and Arizona ; and the prospector who dared the heat and barrenness of that region risked other dangers sometimes as menacing .\nFigures darker than the gloom approached and took shape , and in the light turned out to be those of a white man and a heavily packed burro .\n\" Hello there , \" the man called , as he came to a halt and gazed about him .\n\" I saw your fire .\nMay I make camp here ? \"\nCameron came forth out of the shadow and greeted his visitor , whom he took for a prospector like himself .\nCameron resented the breaking of his lonely campfire vigil , but he respected the law of the desert .\nThe stranger thanked him , and then slipped the pack from his burro .\nThen he rolled out his pack and began preparations for a meal .\nHis movements were slow and methodical .\nCameron watched him , still with resentment , yet with a curious and growing interest .\nThe campfire burst into a bright blaze , and by its light Cameron saw a man whose gray hair somehow did not seem to make him old , and whose stooped shoulders did not detract from an impression of rugged strength .\n\" Find any mineral ? \" asked Cameron , presently .\nHis visitor looked up quickly , as if startled by the sound of a human voice .\nHe replied , and then the two men talked a little .\nBut the stranger evidently preferred silence .\nCameron understood that .\nHe laughed grimly and bent a keener gaze upon the furrowed , shadowy face .\nAnother of those strange desert prospectors in whom there was some relentless driving power besides the lust for gold !\nCameron felt that between this man and himself there was a subtle affinity , vague and undefined , perhaps born of the divination that here was a desert wanderer like himself , perhaps born of a deeper , an unintelligible relation having its roots back in the past .\nA long-forgotten sensation stirred in Cameron 's breast , one so long forgotten that he could not recognize it .\nBut it was akin to pain .\nII When he awakened he found , to his surprise , that his companion had departed .\nA trail in the sand led off to the north .\nThere was no water in that direction .\nCameron shrugged his shoulders ; it was not his affair ; he had his own problems .\nAnd straightway he forgot his strange visitor .\nCameron began his day , grateful for the solitude that was now unbroken , for the canyon-furrowed and cactus-spired scene that now showed no sign of life .\nHe traveled southwest , never straying far from the dry stream bed ; and in a desultory way , without eagerness , he hunted for signs of gold .\nThe work was toilsome , yet the periods of rest in which he indulged were not taken because of fatigue .\nHe rested to look , to listen , to feel .\nWhat the vast silent world meant to him had always been a mystical thing , which he felt in all its incalculable power , but never understood .\nThat day , while it was yet light , and he was digging in a moist white-bordered wash for water , he was brought sharply up by hearing the crack of hard hoofs on stone .\nThere down the canyon came a man and a burro .\nCameron recognized them .\n\" Hello , friend , \" called the man , halting .\n\" Our trails crossed again .\nThat 's good . \"\n\" Hello , \" replied Cameron , slowly .\n\" Any mineral sign to-day ? \"\n\" No . \"\nThey made camp together , ate their frugal meal , smoked a pipe , and rolled in their blankets without exchanging many words .\nIn the morning the same reticence , the same aloofness characterized the manner of both .\nBut Cameron 's companion , when he had packed his burro and was ready to start , faced about and said : \" We might stay together , if it 's all right with you . \"\n\" I never take a partner , \" replied Cameron .\n\" You 're alone ; I 'm alone , \" said the other , mildly .\n\" It 's a big place .\nIf we find gold there 'll be enough for two . \"\n\" I do n't go down into the desert for gold alone , \" rejoined Cameron , with a chill note in his swift reply .\nHis companion 's deep-set , luminous eyes emitted a singular flash .\nIt moved Cameron to say that in the years of his wandering he had met no man who could endure equally with him the blasting heat , the blinding dust storms , the wilderness of sand and rock and lava and cactus , the terrible silence and desolation of the desert .\nCameron waved a hand toward the wide , shimmering , shadowy descent of plain and range .\n\" I may strike through the Sonora Desert .\nI may head for Pinacate or north for the Colorado Basin .\nYou are an old man . \"\n\" I do n't know the country , but to me one place is the same as another , \" replied his companion .\nFor moments he seemed to forget himself , and swept his far-reaching gaze out over the colored gulf of stone and sand .\nThen with gentle slaps he drove his burro in behind Cameron .\n\" Yes , I 'm old .\nI 'm lonely , too .\nIt 's come to me just lately .\nBut , friend , I can still travel , and for a few days my company wo n't hurt you . \"\n\" Have it your way , \" said Cameron .\nThey began a slow march down into the desert .\nAt sunset they camped under the lee of a low mesa .\nCameron was glad his comrade had the Indian habit of silence .\nAnother day 's travel found the prospectors deep in the wilderness .\nThen there came a breaking of reserve , noticeable in the elder man , almost imperceptibly gradual in Cameron .\nBeside the meager mesquite campfire this gray-faced , thoughtful old prospector would remove his black pipe from his mouth to talk a little ; and Cameron would listen , and sometimes unlock his lips to speak a word .\nAnd so , as Cameron began to respond to the influence of a desert less lonely than habitual , he began to take keener note of his comrade , and found him different from any other he had ever encountered in the wilderness .\nThis man never grumbled at the heat , the glare , the driving sand , the sour water , the scant fare .\nDuring the daylight hours he was seldom idle .\nAt night he sat dreaming before the fire or paced to and fro in the gloom .\nHe slept but little , and that long after Cameron had had his own rest .\nHe was tireless , patient , brooding .\nCameron 's awakened interest brought home to him the realization that for years he had shunned companionship .\nIn those years only three men had wandered into the desert with him , and these had left their bones to bleach in the shifting sands .\nCameron had not cared to know their secrets .\nBut the more he studied this latest comrade the more he began to suspect that he might have missed something in the others .\nIn his own driving passion to take his secret into the limitless abode of silence and desolation , where he could be alone with it , he had forgotten that life dealt shocks to other men .\nSomehow this silent comrade reminded him .\nOne afternoon late , after they had toiled up a white , winding wash of sand and gravel , they came upon a dry waterhole .\nCameron dug deep into the sand , but without avail .\nHe was turning to retrace weary steps back to the last water when his comrade asked him to wait .\nCameron watched him search in his pack and bring forth what appeared to be a small , forked branch of a peach tree .\nHe grasped the prongs of the fork and held them before him with the end standing straight out , and then he began to walk along the stream bed .\nCameron , at first amused , then amazed , then pitying , and at last curious , kept pace with the prospector .\nHe saw a strong tension of his comrade 's wrists , as if he was holding hard against a considerable force .\nThe end of the peach branch began to quiver and turn .\nCameron reached out a hand to touch it , and was astounded at feeling a powerful vibrant force pulling the branch downward .\nHe felt it as a magnetic shock .\nThe branch kept turning , and at length pointed to the ground .\n\" Dig here , \" said the prospector .\n\" What ! \" ejaculated Cameron .\nHad the man lost his mind ?\nThen Cameron stood by while his comrade dug in the sand .\nThree feet he dug -- four -- five , and the sand grew dark , then moist .\nAt six feet water began to seep through .\n\" Get the little basket in my pack , \" he said .\nCameron complied , and saw his comrade drop the basket into the deep hole , where it kept the sides from caving in and allowed the water to seep through .\nWhile Cameron watched , the basket filled .\nOf all the strange incidents of his desert career this was the strangest .\nCuriously he picked up the peach branch and held it as he had seen it held .\nThe thing , however , was dead in his hands .\n",

    "Chapter I My father 's family name being Pirrip , and my Christian name Philip , my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip .\nSo , I called myself Pip , and came to be called Pip .\nI give Pirrip as my father 's family name , on the authority of his tombstone and my sister , -- Mrs. Joe Gargery , who married the blacksmith .\nAs I never saw my father or my mother , and never saw any likeness of either of them ( for their days were long before the days of photographs ) , my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones .\nThe shape of the letters on my father 's , gave me an odd idea that he was a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair .\nFrom the character and turn of the inscription , “ Also Georgiana Wife of the Above , ” I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly .\nTo five little stone lozenges , each about a foot and a half long , which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave , and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine , -- who gave up trying to get a living , exceedingly early in that universal struggle , -- I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets , and had never taken them out in this state of existence .\nOurs was the marsh country , down by the river , within , as the river wound , twenty miles of the sea .\nMy first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening .\nAt such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard ; and that Philip Pirrip , late of this parish , and also Georgiana wife of the above , were dead and buried ; and that Alexander , Bartholomew , Abraham , Tobias , and Roger , infant children of the aforesaid , were also dead and buried ; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard , intersected with dikes and mounds and gates , with scattered cattle feeding on it , was the marshes ; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river ; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea ; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry , was Pip .\n“ Hold your noise ! ”\ncried a terrible voice , as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch .\n“ Keep still , you little devil , or I 'll cut your throat ! ”\nA fearful man , all in coarse gray , with a great iron on his leg .\nA man with no hat , and with broken shoes , and with an old rag tied round his head .\nA man who had been soaked in water , and smothered in mud , and lamed by stones , and cut by flints , and stung by nettles , and torn by briars ; who limped , and shivered , and glared , and growled ; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin .\n“ Oh !\nDo n't cut my throat , sir , ” I pleaded in terror .\n“ Pray do n't do it , sir . ”\n“ Tell us your name ! ”\nsaid the man .\n“ Quick ! ”\n“ Pip , sir . ”\n“ Once more , ” said the man , staring at me .\n“ Give it mouth ! ”\n“ Pip .\nPip , sir . ”\n“ Show us where you live , ” said the man .\n“ Pint out the place ! ”\nI pointed to where our village lay , on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards , a mile or more from the church .\nThe man , after looking at me for a moment , turned me upside down , and emptied my pockets .\nThere was nothing in them but a piece of bread .\nWhen the church came to itself , -- for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me , and I saw the steeple under my feet , -- when the church came to itself , I say , I was seated on a high tombstone , trembling while he ate the bread ravenously .\n“ You young dog , ” said the man , licking his lips , “ what fat cheeks you ha ' got . ”\nI believe they were fat , though I was at that time undersized for my years , and not strong .\n“ Darn me if I could n't eat em , ” said the man , with a threatening shake of his head , “ and if I ha n't half a mind to ' t ! ”\nI earnestly expressed my hope that he would n't , and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me ; partly , to keep myself upon it ; partly , to keep myself from crying .\n“ Now lookee here ! ”\nsaid the man .\n“ Where 's your mother ? ”\n“ There , sir ! ”\nsaid I .\nHe started , made a short run , and stopped and looked over his shoulder .\n“ There , sir ! ”\nI timidly explained .\n“ Also Georgiana .\nThat 's my mother . ”\n“ Oh ! ”\nsaid he , coming back .\n“ And is that your father alonger your mother ? ”\n“ Yes , sir , ” said I ; “ him too ; late of this parish . ”\n“ Ha ! ”\nhe muttered then , considering .\n“ Who d'ye live with , -- supposin ' you 're kindly let to live , which I ha n't made up my mind about ? ”\n“ My sister , sir , -- Mrs. Joe Gargery , -- wife of Joe Gargery , the blacksmith , sir . ”\n“ Blacksmith , eh ? ”\nsaid he .\nAnd looked down at his leg .\nAfter darkly looking at his leg and me several times , he came closer to my tombstone , took me by both arms , and tilted me back as far as he could hold me ; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine , and mine looked most helplessly up into his .\n“ Now lookee here , ” he said , “ the question being whether you 're to be let to live .\nYou know what a file is ? ”\n“ Yes , sir . ”\n“ And you know what wittles is ? ”\n“ Yes , sir . ”\nAfter each question he tilted me over a little more , so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger .\n“ You get me a file . ”\nHe tilted me again .\n“ And you get me wittles . ”\nHe tilted me again .\n“ You bring 'em both to me . ”\nHe tilted me again .\n“ Or I 'll have your heart and liver out . ”\nHe tilted me again .\nI was dreadfully frightened , and so giddy that I clung to him with both hands , and said , “ If you would kindly please to let me keep upright , sir , perhaps I should n't be sick , and perhaps I could attend more . ”\nHe gave me a most tremendous dip and roll , so that the church jumped over its own weathercock .\nThen , he held me by the arms , in an upright position on the top of the stone , and went on in these fearful terms : -- “ You bring me , to-morrow morning early , that file and them wittles .\nYou bring the lot to me , at that old Battery over yonder .\nYou do it , and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me , or any person sumever , and you shall be let to live .\nYou fail , or you go from my words in any partickler , no matter how small it is , and your heart and your liver shall be tore out , roasted , and ate .\nNow , I ai n't alone , as you may think I am .\nThere 's a young man hid with me , in comparison with which young man I am a Angel .\nThat young man hears the words I speak .\nThat young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself , of getting at a boy , and at his heart , and at his liver .\nIt is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man .\nA boy may lock his door , may be warm in bed , may tuck himself up , may draw the clothes over his head , may think himself comfortable and safe , but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open .\nI am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment , with great difficulty .\nI find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside .\nNow , what do you say ? ”\nI said that I would get him the file , and I would get him what broken bits of food I could , and I would come to him at the Battery , early in the morning .\n“ Say Lord strike you dead if you do n't ! ”\nsaid the man .\nI said so , and he took me down .\n“ Now , ” he pursued , “ you remember what you 've undertook , and you remember that young man , and you get home ! ”\n“ Goo-good night , sir , ” I faltered .\n“ Much of that ! ”\nsaid he , glancing about him over the cold wet flat .\n“ I wish I was a frog .\nOr a eel ! ”\nAt the same time , he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms , -- clasping himself , as if to hold himself together , -- and limped towards the low church wall .\nAs I saw him go , picking his way among the nettles , and among the brambles that bound the green mounds , he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people , stretching up cautiously out of their graves , to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in .\nWhen he came to the low church wall , he got over it , like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff , and then turned round to look for me .\nWhen I saw him turning , I set my face towards home , and made the best use of my legs .\nBut presently I looked over my shoulder , and saw him going on again towards the river , still hugging himself in both arms , and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there , for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or the tide was in .\n",
