    "Chapter I Major Amberson had “ made a fortune ” in 1873 , when other people were losing fortunes , and the magnificence of the Ambersons began then .\nMagnificence , like the size of a fortune , is always comparative , as even Magnificent Lorenzo may now perceive , if he has happened to haunt New York in 1916 ; and the Ambersons were magnificent in their day and place .\nTheir splendour lasted throughout all the years that saw their Midland town spread and darken into a city , but reached its topmost during the period when every prosperous family with children kept a Newfoundland dog .\nIn that town , in those days , all the women who wore silk or velvet knew all the other women who wore silk or velvet , and when there was a new purchase of sealskin , sick people were got to windows to see it go by .\nTrotters were out , in the winter afternoons , racing light sleighs on National Avenue and Tennessee Street ; everybody recognized both the trotters and the drivers ; and again knew them as well on summer evenings , when slim buggies whizzed by in renewals of the snow-time rivalry .\nFor that matter , everybody knew everybody else 's family horse-and-carriage , could identify such a silhouette half a mile down the street , and thereby was sure who was going to market , or to a reception , or coming home from office or store to noon dinner or evening supper .\nDuring the earlier years of this period , elegance of personal appearance was believed to rest more upon the texture of garments than upon their shaping .\nA silk dress needed no remodelling when it was a year or so old ; it remained distinguished by merely remaining silk .\nOld men and governors wore broadcloth ; “ full dress ” was broadcloth with “ doeskin ” trousers ; and there were seen men of all ages to whom a hat meant only that rigid , tall silk thing known to impudence as a “ stove-pipe . ”\nIn town and country these men would wear no other hat , and , without self-consciousness , they went rowing in such hats .\nShifting fashions of shape replaced aristocracy of texture : dressmakers , shoemakers , hatmakers , and tailors , increasing in cunning and in power , found means to make new clothes old .\nThe long contagion of the “ Derby ” hat arrived : one season the crown of this hat would be a bucket ; the next it would be a spoon .\nEvery house still kept its bootjack , but high-topped boots gave way to shoes and “ congress gaiters ” ; and these were played through fashions that shaped them now with toes like box-ends and now with toes like the prows of racing shells .\nTrousers with a crease were considered plebeian ; the crease proved that the garment had lain upon a shelf , and hence was “ ready-made ” ; these betraying trousers were called “ hand-me-downs , ” in allusion to the shelf .\nIn the early ' eighties , while bangs and bustles were having their way with women , that variation of dandy known as the “ dude ” was invented : he wore trousers as tight as stockings , dagger-pointed shoes , a spoon “ Derby , ” a single-breasted coat called a “ Chesterfield , ” with short flaring skirts , a torturing cylindrical collar , laundered to a polish and three inches high , while his other neckgear might be a heavy , puffed cravat or a tiny bow fit for a doll 's braids .\nWith evening dress he wore a tan overcoat so short that his black coat-tails hung visible , five inches below the over-coat ; but after a season or two he lengthened his overcoat till it touched his heels , and he passed out of his tight trousers into trousers like great bags .\nThen , presently , he was seen no more , though the word that had been coined for him remained in the vocabularies of the impertinent .\nIt was a hairier day than this .\nBeards were to the wearers ' fancy , and things as strange as the Kaiserliche boar-tusk moustache were commonplace .\n“ Side-burns ” found nourishment upon childlike profiles ; great Dundreary whiskers blew like tippets over young shoulders ; moustaches were trained as lambrequins over forgotten mouths ; and it was possible for a Senator of the United States to wear a mist of white whisker upon his throat only , not a newspaper in the land finding the ornament distinguished enough to warrant a lampoon .\nSurely no more is needed to prove that so short a time ago we were living in another age !\nAt the beginning of the Ambersons ' great period most of the houses of the Midland town were of a pleasant architecture .\nThey lacked style , but also lacked pretentiousness , and whatever does not pretend at all has style enough .\nThey stood in commodious yards , well shaded by leftover forest trees , elm and walnut and beech , with here and there a line of tall sycamores where the land had been made by filling bayous from the creek .\nThe house of a “ prominent resident , ” facing Military Square , or National Avenue , or Tennessee Street , was built of brick upon a stone foundation , or of wood upon a brick foundation .\nUsually it had a “ front porch ” and a “ back porch ” ; often a “ side porch , ” too .\nThere was a “ front hall ” ; there was a “ side hall ” ; and sometimes a “ back hall . ”\nFrom the “ front hall ” opened three rooms , the “ parlour , ” the “ sitting room , ” and the “ library ” ; and the library could show warrant to its title -- for some reason these people bought books .\nCommonly , the family sat more in the library than in the “ sitting room , ” while callers , when they came formally , were kept to the “ parlour , ” a place of formidable polish and discomfort .\nThe upholstery of the library furniture was a little shabby ; but the hostile chairs and sofa of the “ parlour ” always looked new .\nFor all the wear and tear they got they should have lasted a thousand years .\nUpstairs were the bedrooms ; “ mother-and-father 's room ” the largest ; a smaller room for one or two sons another for one or two daughters ; each of these rooms containing a double bed , a “ washstand , ” a “ bureau , ” a wardrobe , a little table , a rocking-chair , and often a chair or two that had been slightly damaged downstairs , but not enough to justify either the expense of repair or decisive abandonment in the attic .\nAnd there was always a “ spare-room , ” for visitors ( where the sewing-machine usually was kept ) , and during the ' seventies there developed an appreciation of the necessity for a bathroom .\nTherefore the architects placed bathrooms in the new houses , and the older houses tore out a cupboard or two , set up a boiler beside the kitchen stove , and sought a new godliness , each with its own bathroom .\nThe great American plumber joke , that many-branched evergreen , was planted at this time .\nAt the rear of the house , upstairs was a bleak little chamber , called “ the girl 's room , ” and in the stable there was another bedroom , adjoining the hayloft , and called “ the hired man 's room . ”\nHouse and stable cost seven or eight thousand dollars to build , and people with that much money to invest in such comforts were classified as the Rich .\nThey paid the inhabitant of “ the girl 's room ” two dollars a week , and , in the latter part of this period , two dollars and a half , and finally three dollars a week .\nShe was Irish , ordinarily , or German or it might be Scandinavian , but never native to the land unless she happened to be a person of colour .\nThe man or youth who lived in the stable had like wages , and sometimes he , too , was lately a steerage voyager , but much oftener he was coloured .\nAfter sunrise , on pleasant mornings , the alleys behind the stables were gay ; laughter and shouting went up and down their dusty lengths , with a lively accompaniment of curry-combs knocking against back fences and stable walls , for the darkies loved to curry their horses in the alley .\nDarkies always prefer to gossip in shouts instead of whispers ; and they feel that profanity , unless it be vociferous , is almost worthless .\nHorrible phrases were caught by early rising children and carried to older people for definition , sometimes at inopportune moments ; while less investigative children would often merely repeat the phrases in some subsequent flurry of agitation , and yet bring about consequences so emphatic as to be recalled with ease in middle life .\nThey have passed , those darky hired-men of the Midland town ; and the introspective horses they curried and brushed and whacked and amiably cursed -- those good old horses switch their tails at flies no more .\nFor all their seeming permanence they might as well have been buffaloes -- or the buffalo laprobes that grew bald in patches and used to slide from the careless drivers ' knees and hang unconcerned , half way to the ground .\nThe stables have been transformed into other likenesses , or swept away , like the woodsheds where were kept the stove-wood and kindling that the “ girl ” and the “ hired-man ” always quarrelled over : who should fetch it .\nHorse and stable and woodshed , and the whole tribe of the “ hired-man , ” all are gone .\nThey went quickly , yet so silently that we whom they served have not yet really noticed that they are vanished .\nSo with other vanishings .\nThere were the little bunty street-cars on the long , single track that went its troubled way among the cobblestones .\nAt the rear door of the car there was no platform , but a step where passengers clung in wet clumps when the weather was bad and the car crowded .\nThe patrons -- if not too absent-minded -- put their fares into a slot ; and no conductor paced the heaving floor , but the driver would rap remindingly with his elbow upon the glass of the door to his little open platform if the nickels and the passengers did not appear to coincide in number .\nA lone mule drew the car , and sometimes drew it off the track , when the passengers would get out and push it on again .\nThey really owed it courtesies like this , for the car was genially accommodating : a lady could whistle to it from an upstairs window , and the car would halt at once and wait for her while she shut the window , put on her hat and cloak , went downstairs , found an umbrella , told the “ girl ” what to have for dinner , and came forth from the house .\nThe previous passengers made little objection to such gallantry on the part of the car : they were wont to expect as much for themselves on like occasion .\nIn good weather the mule pulled the car a mile in a little less than twenty minutes , unless the stops were too long ; but when the trolley-car came , doing its mile in five minutes and better , it would wait for nobody .\nNor could its passengers have endured such a thing , because the faster they were carried the less time they had to spare !\nIn the days before deathly contrivances hustled them through their lives , and when they had no telephones -- another ancient vacancy profoundly responsible for leisure -- they had time for everything : time to think , to talk , time to read , time to wait for a lady !\n",

    "CHAPTER I THE SLAVE 'S SOCIAL CIRCLE .\nWith the growing population in the Southern States , the increase of mulattoes has been very great .\nSociety does not frown upon the man who sits with his half-white child upon his knee whilst the mother stands , a slave , behind his chair .\nIn nearly all the cities and towns of the Slave States , the real negro , or clear black , does not amount to more than one in four of the slave population .\nThis fact is of itself the best evidence of the degraded and immoral condition of the relation of master and slave .\nThroughout the Southern States , there is a class of slaves who , in most of the towns , are permitted to hire their time from their owners , and who are always expected to pay a high price .\nThis class is the mulatto women , distinguished for their fascinating beauty .\nThe handsomest of these usually pay the greatest amount for their time .\nMany of these women are the favorites of men of property and standing , who furnish them with the means of compensating their owners , and not a few are dressed in the most extravagant manner .\nWhen we take into consideration the fact that no safeguard is thrown around virtue , and no inducement held out to slave-women to be pure and chaste , we will not be surprised when told that immorality and vice pervade the cities and towns of the South to an extent unknown in the Northern States .\nIndeed , many of the slave-women have no higher aspiration than that of becoming the finely-dressed mistress of some white man .\nAt negro balls and parties , this class of women usually make the most splendid appearance , and are eagerly sought after in the dance , or to entertain in the drawing-room or at the table .\nA few years ago , among the many slave-women in Richmond , Virginia , who hired their time of their masters , was Agnes , a mulatto owned by John Graves , Esq. , and who might be heard boasting that she was the daughter of an American Senator .\nAlthough nearly forty years of age at the time of which we write , Agnes was still exceedingly handsome .\nMore than half white , with long black hair and deep blue eyes , no one felt like disputing with her when she urged her claim to her relationship with the Anglo-Saxon .\nIn her younger days , Agnes had been a housekeeper for a young slaveholder , and in sustaining this relation had become the mother of two daughters .\nAfter being cast aside by this young man , the slave-woman betook herself to the business of a laundress , and was considered to be the most tasteful woman in Richmond at her vocation .\nIsabella and Marion , the two daughters of Agnes , resided with their mother , and gave her what aid they could in her business .\nThe mother , however , was very choice of her daughters , and would allow them to perform no labor that would militate against their lady-like appearance .\nAgnes early resolved to bring up her daughters as ladies , as she termed it .\nAs the girls grew older , the mother had to pay a stipulated price for them per month .\nHer notoriety as a laundress of the first class enabled her to put an extra charge upon the linen that passed through her hands ; and although she imposed little or no work upon her daughters , she was enabled to live in comparative luxury and have her daughters dressed to attract attention , especially at the negro balls and parties .\nAlthough the term \" negro ball \" is applied to these gatherings , yet a large portion of the men who attend them are whites .\nNegro balls and parties in the Southern States , especially in the cities and towns , are usually made up of quadroon women , a few negro men , and any number of white gentlemen .\nThese are gatherings of the most democratic character .\nBankers , merchants , lawyers , doctors , and their clerks and students , all take part in these social assemblies upon terms of perfect equality .\nThe father and son not unfrequently meet and dance alike at a negro ball .\nIt was at one of these parties that Henry Linwood , the son of a wealthy and retired gentleman of Richmond , was first introduced to Isabella , the oldest daughter of Agnes .\nThe young man had just returned from Harvard College , where he had spent the previous five years .\nIsabella was in her eighteenth year , and was admitted by all who knew her to be the handsomest girl , colored or white , in the city .\nOn this occasion , she was attired in a sky-blue silk dress , with deep black lace flounces , and bertha of the same .\nOn her well-moulded arms she wore massive gold bracelets , while her rich black hair was arranged at the back in broad basket plaits , ornamented with pearls , and the front in the French style ( a la Imperatrice ) , which suited her classic face to perfection .\nMarion was scarcely less richly dressed than her sister .\nHenry Linwood paid great attention to Isabella which was looked upon with gratification by her mother , and became a matter of general conversation with all present .\nOf course , the young man escorted the beautiful quadroon home that evening , and became the favorite visitor at the house of Agnes .\nIt was on a beautiful moonlight night in the month of August when all who reside in tropical climates are eagerly grasping for a breath of fresh air , that Henry Linwood was in the garden which surrounded Agnes ' cottage , with the young quadroon by his side .\nHe drew from his pocket a newspaper wet from the press , and read the following advertisement : -- NOTICE .\n-- Seventy-nine negroes will be offered for sale on Monday , September 10 , at 12 o'clock , being the entire stock of the late John Graves in an excellent condition , and all warranted against the common vices .\nAmong them are several mechanics , able-bodied field-hands , plough-boys , and women with children , some of them very prolific , affording a rare opportunity for any one who wishes to raise a strong and healthy lot of servants for their own use .\nAlso several mulatto girls of rare personal qualities , -- two of these very superior .\nAmong the above slaves advertised for sale were Agnes and her two daughters .\nEre young Linwood left the quadroon that evening , he promised her that he would become her purchaser , and make her free and her own mistress .\nMr. Graves had long been considered not only an excellent and upright citizen of the first standing among the whites , but even the slaves regarded him as one of the kindest of masters .\nHaving inherited his slaves with the rest of his property , he became possessed of them without any consultation or wish of his own .\nHe would neither buy nor sell slaves , and was exceedingly careful , in letting them out , that they did not find oppressive and tyrannical masters .\nNo slave speculator ever dared to cross the threshold of this planter of the Old Dominion .\nHe was a constant attendant upon religious worship , and was noted for his general benevolence .\nThe American Bible Society , the American Tract Society , and the cause of Foreign Missions , found in him a liberal friend .\nHe was always anxious that his slaves should appear well on the Sabbath , and have an opportunity of hearing the word of God .\nCHAPTER II THE NEGRO SALE .\nAs might have been expected , the day of sale brought an usually large number together to compete for the property to be sold .\nFarmers , who make a business of raising slaves for the market , were there , and slave-traders , who make a business of buying human beings in the slave-raising States and taking them to the far South , were also in attendance .\nMen and women , too , who wished to purchase for their own use , had found their way to the slave sale .\nIn the midst of the throne was one who felt a deeper interest in the result of the sale than any other of the bystanders .\nThis was young Linwood .\nTrue to his promise , he was there with a blank bank-check in his pocket , awaiting with impatience to enter the list as a bidder for the beautiful slave .\nIt was indeed a heart-rending scene to witness the lamentations of these slaves , all of whom had grown up together on the old homestead of Mr. Graves , and who had been treated with great kindness by that gentleman , during his life .\nNow they were to be separated , and form new relations and companions .\nSuch is the precarious condition of the slave .\nEven when with a good master , there is no certainty of his happiness in the future .\nThe less valuable slaves were first placed upon the auction-block , one after another , and sold to the highest bidder .\nHusbands and wives were separated with a degree of indifference that is unknown in any other relation in life .\nBrothers and sisters were tom from each other , and mothers saw their children for the last time on earth .\nIt was late in the day , and when the greatest number of persons were thought to be present , when Agnes and her daughters were brought out to the place of sale .\nThe mother was first put upon the auction-block , and sold to a noted negro trader named Jennings .\nMarion was next ordered to ascend the stand , which she did with a trembling step , and was sold for $ 1200 .\nAll eyes were now turned on Isabella , as she was led forward by the auctioneer .\nThe appearance of the handsome quadroon caused a deep sensation among the crowd .\nThere she stood , with a skin as fair as most white women , her features as beautifully regular as any of her sex of pure Anglo-Saxon blood , her long black hair done up in the neatest manner , her form tall and graceful , and her whole appearance indicating one superior to her condition .\nThe auctioneer commenced by saying that Miss Isabella was fit to deck the drawing-room of the finest mansion in Virginia .\n\" How much , gentlemen , for this real Albino !\n-- fit fancy-girl for any one !\nShe enjoys good health , and has a sweet temper .\nHow much do you say ? \"\n\" Five hundred dollars . \"\n\" Only five hundred for such a girl as this ?\nGentlemen , she is worth a deal more than that sum .\nYou certainly do not know the value of the article you are bidding on .\nHere , gentlemen , I hold in my hand a paper certifying that she has a good moral character . \"\n\" Seven hundred . \"\n\" Ah , gentlemen , that is something like .\nThis paper also states that she is very intelligent . \"\n\" Eight hundred . \"\n\" She was first sprinkled , then immersed , and is now warranted to be a devoted Christian , and perfectly trustworthy . \"\n",

    "STONE GATE , WORCESTER , MASSACHUSETTS , December 27 .\nDear Judy : Your letter is here .\nI have read it twice , and with amazement .\nDo I understand that Jervis has given you , for a Christmas present , the making over of the John Grier Home into a model institution , and that you have chosen me to disburse the money ?\nMe -- I , Sallie McBride , the head of an orphan asylum !\nMy poor people , have you lost your senses , or have you become addicted to the use of opium , and is this the raving of two fevered imaginations ?\nI am exactly as well fitted to take care of one hundred children as to become the curator of a zoo .\nAnd you offer as bait an interesting Scotch doctor ?\nMy dear Judy , -- likewise my dear Jervis , -- I see through you !\nI know exactly the kind of family conference that has been held about the Pendleton fireside .\n\" Is n't it a pity that Sallie has n't amounted to more since she left college ?\nShe ought to be doing something useful instead of frittering her time away in the petty social life of Worcester .\nAlso [ Jervis speaks ] she is getting interested in that confounded young Hallock , too good-looking and fascinating and erratic ; I never did like politicians .\nWe must deflect her mind with some uplifting and absorbing occupation until the danger is past .\nHa !\nI have it !\nWe will put her in charge of the John Grier Home . \"\nOh , I can hear him as clearly as if I were there !\nOn the occasion of my last visit in your delectable household Jervis and I had a very solemn conversation in regard to ( 1 ) marriage , ( 2 ) the low ideals of politicians , ( 3 ) the frivolous , useless lives that society women lead .\nPlease tell your moral husband that I took his words deeply to heart , and that ever since my return to Worcester I have been spending one afternoon a week reading poetry with the inmates of the Female Inebriate Asylum .\nMy life is not so purposeless as it appears .\nAlso let me assure you that the politician is not dangerously imminent ; and that , anyway , he is a very desirable politician , even though his views on tariff and single tax and trade-unionism do not exactly coincide with Jervis 's .\nYour desire to dedicate my life to the public good is very sweet , but you should look at it from the asylum 's point of view .\nHave you no pity for those poor defenseless little orphan children ?\nI have , if you have n't , and I respectfully decline the position which you offer .\nI shall be charmed , however , to accept your invitation to visit you in New York , though I must acknowledge that I am not very excited over the list of gaieties you have planned .\nPlease substitute for the New York Orphanage and the Foundling Hospital a few theaters and operas and a dinner or so .\nI have two new evening gowns and a blue and gold coat with a white fur collar .\nI dash to pack them ; so telegraph fast if you do n't wish to see me for myself alone , but only as a successor to Mrs. Lippett .\nYours as ever , Entirely frivolous , And intending to remain so , SALLIE McBRIDE .\nP.S. Your invitation is especially seasonable .\nA charming young politician named Gordon Hallock is to be in New York next week .\nI am sure you will like him when you know him better .\nP.S. 2 .\nSallie taking her afternoon walk as Judy would like to see her : I ask you again , have you both gone mad ?\nTHE JOHN GRIER HOME , February 15 .\nDear Judy : We arrived in a snowstorm at eleven last night , Singapore and Jane and I .\nIt does not appear to be customary for superintendents of orphan asylums to bring with them personal maids and Chinese chows .\nThe night watchman and housekeeper , who had waited up to receive me , were thrown into an awful flutter .\nThey had never seen the like of Sing , and thought that I was introducing a wolf into the fold .\nI reassured them as to his dogginess , and the watchman , after studying his black tongue , ventured a witticism .\nHe wanted to know if I fed him on huckleberry pie .\nIt was difficult to find accommodations for my family .\nPoor Sing was dragged off whimpering to a strange woodshed , and given a piece of burlap .\nJane did not fare much better .\nThere was not an extra bed in the building , barring a five-foot crib in the hospital room .\nShe , as you know , approaches six .\nWe tucked her in , and she spent the night folded up like a jackknife .\nShe has limped about today , looking like a decrepit letter S , openly deploring this latest escapade on the part of her flighty mistress , and longing for the time when we shall come to our senses , and return to the parental fireside in Worcester .\nI know that she is going to spoil all my chances of being popular with the rest of the staff .\nHaving her here is the silliest idea that was ever conceived , but you know my family .\nI fought their objections step by step , but they made their last stand on Jane .\nIf I brought her along to see that I ate nourishing food and did n't stay up all night , I might come -- temporarily ; but if I refused to bring her -- oh , dear me , I am not sure that I was ever again to cross the threshold of Stone Gate !\nSo here we are , and neither of us very welcome , I am afraid .\nI woke by a gong at six this morning , and lay for a time listening to the racket that twenty-five little girls made in the lavatory over my head .\nIt appears that they do not get baths , -- just face-washes , -- but they make as much splashing as twenty-five puppies in a pool .\nI rose and dressed and explored a bit .\nYou were wise in not having me come to look the place over before I engaged .\nWhile my little charges were at breakfast , it seemed a happy time to introduce myself ; so I sought the dining room .\nHorror piled on horror -- those bare drab walls and oil-cloth-covered tables with tin cups and plates and wooden benches , and , by way of decoration , that one illuminated text , \" The Lord Will Provide \" !\nThe trustee who added that last touch must possess a grim sense of humor .\nReally , Judy , I never knew there was any spot in the world so entirely ugly ; and when I saw those rows and rows of pale , listless , blue-uniformed children , the whole dismal business suddenly struck me with such a shock that I almost collapsed .\nIt seemed like an unachievable goal for one person to bring sunshine to one hundred little faces when what they need is a mother apiece .\nI plunged into this thing lightly enough , partly because you were too persuasive , and mostly , I honestly think , because that scurrilous Gordon Hallock laughed so uproariously at the idea of my being able to manage an asylum .\nBetween you all you hypnotized me .\nAnd then of course , after I began reading up on the subject and visiting all those seventeen institutions , I got excited over orphans , and wanted to put my own ideas into practice .\nBut now I 'm aghast at finding myself here ; it 's such a stupendous undertaking .\nThe future health and happiness of a hundred human beings lie in my hands , to say nothing of their three or four hundred children and thousand grandchildren .\nThe thing 's geometrically progressive .\nIt 's awful .\nWho am I to undertake this job ?\nLook , oh , look for another superintendent !\nJane says dinner 's ready .\nHaving eaten two of your institution meals , the thought of another does n't excite me .\nLATER .\nThe staff had mutton hash and spinach , with tapioca pudding for dessert .\nWhat the children had I hate to consider .\nI started to tell you about my first official speech at breakfast this morning .\nIt dealt with all the wonderful new changes that are to come to the John Grier Home through the generosity of Mr. Jervis Pendleton , the president of our board of trustees , and of Mrs. Pendleton , the dear \" Aunt Judy \" of every little boy and girl here .\nPlease do n't object to my featuring the Pendleton family so prominently .\nI did it for political reasons .\nAs the entire working staff of the institution was present , I thought it a good opportunity to emphasize the fact that all of these upsetting , innovations come straight from headquarters , and not out of my excitable brain .\nThe children stopped eating and stared .\nThe conspicuous color of my hair and the frivolous tilt of my nose are evidently new attributes in a superintendent .\nMy colleagues also showed plainly that they consider me too young and too inexperienced to be set in authority .\nI have n't seen Jervis 's wonderful Scotch doctor yet , but I assure you that he will have to be VERY wonderful to make up for the rest of these people , especially the kindergarten teacher .\nMiss Snaith and I clashed early on the subject of fresh air ; but I intend to get rid of this dreadful institution smell , if I freeze every child into a little ice statue .\nThis being a sunny , sparkling , snowy afternoon , I ordered that dungeon of a playroom closed and the children out of doors .\n\" She 's chasin ' us out , \" I heard one small urchin grumbling as he struggled into a two-years-too-small overcoat .\nThey simply stood about the yard , all humped in their clothes , waiting patiently to be allowed to come back in .\nNo running or shouting or coasting or snowballs .\nThink of it !\nThese children do n't know how to play .\nSTILL LATER .\nI have already begun the congenial task of spending your money .\nI bought eleven hot-water bottles this afternoon ( every one that the village drug store contained ) likewise some woolen blankets and padded quilts .\nAnd the windows are wide open in the babies ' dormitory .\nThose poor little tots are going to enjoy the perfectly new sensation of being able to breathe at night .\nThere are a million things I want to grumble about , but it 's half-past ten , and Jane says I MUST go to bed .\nYours in command , SALLIE McBRIDE .\nP.S. Before turning in , I tiptoed through the corridor to make sure that all was right , and what do you think I found ?\nMiss Snaith softly closing the windows in the babies ' dormitory !\nJust as soon as I can find a suitable position for her in an old ladies ' home , I am going to discharge that woman .\n",

    "CHAPTER I 1801 .\n-- I have just returned from a visit to my landlord -- the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with .\nThis is certainly a beautiful country !\nIn all England , I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society .\nA perfect misanthropist 's heaven : and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us .\nA capital fellow !\nHe little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows , as I rode up , and when his fingers sheltered themselves , with a jealous resolution , still further in his waistcoat , as I announced my name .\n' Mr. Heathcliff ? '\nI said .\nA nod was the answer .\n' Mr. Lockwood , your new tenant , sir .\nI do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival , to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange : I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts -- ' ' Thrushcross Grange is my own , sir , ' he interrupted , wincing . '\nI should not allow any one to inconvenience me , if I could hinder it -- walk in ! '\nThe ' walk in ' was uttered with closed teeth , and expressed the sentiment , ' Go to the Deuce : ' even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words ; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation : I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself .\nWhen he saw my horse 's breast fairly pushing the barrier , he did put out his hand to unchain it , and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway , calling , as we entered the court , -- ' Joseph , take Mr. Lockwood 's horse ; and bring up some wine . '\n' Here we have the whole establishment of domestics , I suppose , ' was the reflection suggested by this compound order .\n' No wonder the grass grows up between the flags , and cattle are the only hedge-cutters . '\nJoseph was an elderly , nay , an old man : very old , perhaps , though hale and sinewy .\n' The Lord help us ! '\nhe soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure , while relieving me of my horse : looking , meantime , in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner , and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent .\nWuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff 's dwelling .\n' Wuthering ' being a significant provincial adjective , descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather .\nPure , bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times , indeed : one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge , by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house ; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way , as if craving alms of the sun .\nHappily , the architect had foresight to build it strong : the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall , and the corners defended with large jutting stones .\nBefore passing the threshold , I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front , and especially about the principal door ; above which , among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys , I detected the date ' 1500 , ' and the name ' Hareton Earnshaw . '\nI would have made a few comments , and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner ; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance , or complete departure , and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium .\nOne stop brought us into the family sitting-room , without any introductory lobby or passage : they call it here ' the house ' pre-eminently .\nIt includes kitchen and parlour , generally ; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter : at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues , and a clatter of culinary utensils , deep within ; and I observed no signs of roasting , boiling , or baking , about the huge fireplace ; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls .\nOne end , indeed , reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes , interspersed with silver jugs and tankards , towering row after row , on a vast oak dresser , to the very roof .\nThe latter had never been under-drawn : its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye , except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef , mutton , and ham , concealed it .\nAbove the chimney were sundry villainous old guns , and a couple of horse-pistols : and , by way of ornament , three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge .\nThe floor was of smooth , white stone ; the chairs , high-backed , primitive structures , painted green : one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade .\nIn an arch under the dresser reposed a huge , liver-coloured bitch pointer , surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies ; and other dogs haunted other recesses .\nThe apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely , northern farmer , with a stubborn countenance , and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters .\nSuch an individual seated in his arm-chair , his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him , is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills , if you go at the right time after dinner .\nBut Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living .\nHe is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect , in dress and manners a gentleman : that is , as much a gentleman as many a country squire : rather slovenly , perhaps , yet not looking amiss with his negligence , because he has an erect and handsome figure ; and rather morose .\nPossibly , some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride ; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort : I know , by instinct , his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling -- to manifestations of mutual kindliness .\nHe 'll love and hate equally under cover , and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again .\nNo , I 'm running on too fast : I bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him .\nMr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be acquaintance , to those which actuate me .\nLet me hope my constitution is almost peculiar : my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home ; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one .\nWhile enjoying a month of fine weather at the sea-coast , I was thrown into the company of a most fascinating creature : a real goddess in my eyes , as long as she took no notice of me .\nI ' never told my love ' vocally ; still , if looks have language , the merest idiot might have guessed I was over head and ears : she understood me at last , and looked a return -- the sweetest of all imaginable looks .\nAnd what did I do ?\nI confess it with shame -- shrunk icily into myself , like a snail ; at every glance retired colder and farther ; till finally the poor innocent was led to doubt her own senses , and , overwhelmed with confusion at her supposed mistake , persuaded her mamma to decamp .\nBy this curious turn of disposition I have gained the reputation of deliberate heartlessness ; how undeserved , I alone can appreciate .\nI took a seat at the end of the hearthstone opposite that towards which my landlord advanced , and filled up an interval of silence by attempting to caress the canine mother , who had left her nursery , and was sneaking wolfishly to the back of my legs , her lip curled up , and her white teeth watering for a snatch .\nMy caress provoked a long , guttural gnarl .\n' You 'd better let the dog alone , ' growled Mr. Heathcliff in unison , checking fiercer demonstrations with a punch of his foot .\n' She 's not accustomed to be spoiled -- not kept for a pet . '\nThen , striding to a side door , he shouted again , ' Joseph ! '\nJoseph mumbled indistinctly in the depths of the cellar , but gave no intimation of ascending ; so his master dived down to him , leaving me _ vis-a-vis _ the ruffianly bitch and a pair of grim shaggy sheep-dogs , who shared with her a jealous guardianship over all my movements .\nNot anxious to come in contact with their fangs , I sat still ; but , imagining they would scarcely understand tacit insults , I unfortunately indulged in winking and making faces at the trio , and some turn of my physiognomy so irritated madam , that she suddenly broke into a fury and leapt on my knees .\nI flung her back , and hastened to interpose the table between us .\nThis proceeding aroused the whole hive : half-a-dozen four-footed fiends , of various sizes and ages , issued from hidden dens to the common centre .\nI felt my heels and coat-laps peculiar subjects of assault ; and parrying off the larger combatants as effectually as I could with the poker , I was constrained to demand , aloud , assistance from some of the household in re-establishing peace .\nMr. Heathcliff and his man climbed the cellar steps with vexatious phlegm : I do n't think they moved one second faster than usual , though the hearth was an absolute tempest of worrying and yelping .\nHappily , an inhabitant of the kitchen made more despatch : a lusty dame , with tucked-up gown , bare arms , and fire-flushed cheeks , rushed into the midst of us flourishing a frying-pan : and used that weapon , and her tongue , to such purpose , that the storm subsided magically , and she only remained , heaving like a sea after a high wind , when her master entered on the scene .\n' What the devil is the matter ? '\nhe asked , eyeing me in a manner that I could ill endure , after this inhospitable treatment .\n' What the devil , indeed ! '\nI muttered .\n' The herd of possessed swine could have had no worse spirits in them than those animals of yours , sir .\nYou might as well leave a stranger with a brood of tigers ! '\n' They wo n't meddle with persons who touch nothing , ' he remarked , putting the bottle before me , and restoring the displaced table .\n' The dogs do right to be vigilant .\nTake a glass of wine ?

    "Chapter 1 .\nMr. Sherlock Holmes Mr. Sherlock Holmes , who was usually very late in the mornings , save upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night , was seated at the breakfast table .\nI stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before .\nIt was a fine , thick piece of wood , bulbous-headed , of the sort which is known as a “ Penang lawyer . ”\nJust under the head was a broad silver band nearly an inch across .\n“ To James Mortimer , M.R.C.S. , from his friends of the C.C.H. , ” was engraved upon it , with the date “ 1884 . ”\nIt was just such a stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry -- dignified , solid , and reassuring .\n“ Well , Watson , what do you make of it ? ”\nHolmes was sitting with his back to me , and I had given him no sign of my occupation .\n“ How did you know what I was doing ?\nI believe you have eyes in the back of your head . ”\n“ I have , at least , a well-polished , silver-plated coffee-pot in front of me , ” said he .\n“ But , tell me , Watson , what do you make of our visitor ’s stick ?\nSince we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no notion of his errand , this accidental souvenir becomes of importance .\nLet me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it . ”\n“ I think , ” said I , following as far as I could the methods of my companion , “ that Dr. Mortimer is a successful , elderly medical man , well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their appreciation . ”\n“ Good ! ” said Holmes .\n“ Excellent ! ”\n“ I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot . ”\n“ Why so ? ”\n“ Because this stick , though originally a very handsome one has been so knocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it .\nThe thick-iron ferrule is worn down , so it is evident that he has done a great amount of walking with it . ”\n“ Perfectly sound ! ” said Holmes .\n“ And then again , there is the ‘ friends of the C.C.H. ’ I should guess that to be the Something Hunt , the local hunt to whose members he has possibly given some surgical assistance , and which has made him a small presentation in return . ”\n“ Really , Watson , you excel yourself , ” said Holmes , pushing back his chair and lighting a cigarette .\n“ I am bound to say that in all the accounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small achievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities .\nIt may be that you are not yourself luminous , but you are a conductor of light .\nSome people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it .\nI confess , my dear fellow , that I am very much in your debt . ”\nHe had never said as much before , and I must admit that his words gave me keen pleasure , for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my admiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to his methods .\nI was proud , too , to think that I had so far mastered his system as to apply it in a way which earned his approval .\nHe now took the stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked eyes .\nThen with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette , and carrying the cane to the window , he looked over it again with a convex lens .\n“ Interesting , though elementary , ” said he as he returned to his favourite corner of the settee .\n“ There are certainly one or two indications upon the stick .\nIt gives us the basis for several deductions . ”\n“ Has anything escaped me ? ”\nI asked with some self-importance .\n“ I trust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked ? ”\n“ I am afraid , my dear Watson , that most of your conclusions were erroneous .\nWhen I said that you stimulated me I meant , to be frank , that in noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth .\nNot that you are entirely wrong in this instance .\nThe man is certainly a country practitioner .\nAnd he walks a good deal . ”\n“ Then I was right . ”\n“ To that extent . ”\n“ But that was all . ”\n“ No , no , my dear Watson , not all -- by no means all .\nI would suggest , for example , that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a hospital than from a hunt , and that when the initials ‘ C.C. ’ are placed before that hospital the words ‘ Charing Cross ’ very naturally suggest themselves . ”\n“ You may be right . ”\n“ The probability lies in that direction .\nAnd if we take this as a working hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our construction of this unknown visitor . ”\n“ Well , then , supposing that ‘ C.C.H. ’ does stand for ‘ Charing Cross Hospital , ’ what further inferences may we draw ? ”\n“ Do none suggest themselves ?\nYou know my methods .\nApply them ! ”\n“ I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised in town before going to the country . ”\n“ I think that we might venture a little farther than this .\nLook at it in this light .\nOn what occasion would it be most probable that such a presentation would be made ?\nWhen would his friends unite to give him a pledge of their good will ?\nObviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice for himself .\nWe know there has been a presentation .\nWe believe there has been a change from a town hospital to a country practice .\nIs it , then , stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the occasion of the change ? ”\n“ It certainly seems probable . ”\n“ Now , you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the hospital , since only a man well-established in a London practice could hold such a position , and such a one would not drift into the country .\nWhat was he , then ?\nIf he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he could only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician -- little more than a senior student .\nAnd he left five years ago -- the date is on the stick .\nSo your grave , middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin air , my dear Watson , and there emerges a young fellow under thirty , amiable , unambitious , absent-minded , and the possessor of a favourite dog , which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and smaller than a mastiff . ”\nI laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling .\n“ As to the latter part , I have no means of checking you , ” said I , “ but at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the man ’s age and professional career . ”\nFrom my small medical shelf I took down the Medical Directory and turned up the name .\nThere were several Mortimers , but only one who could be our visitor .\nI read his record aloud .\n“ Mortimer , James , M.R.C.S. , 1882 , Grimpen , Dartmoor , Devon .\nHouse-surgeon , from 1882 to 1884 , at Charing Cross Hospital .\nWinner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology , with essay entitled ‘ Is Disease a Reversion ? ’\nCorresponding member of the Swedish Pathological Society .\nAuthor of ‘ Some Freaks of Atavism ’ ( Lancet 1882 ) .\n‘ Do We Progress ? ’\n( Journal of Psychology , March , 1883 ) .\nMedical Officer for the parishes of Grimpen , Thorsley , and High Barrow . ”\n“ No mention of that local hunt , Watson , ” said Holmes with a mischievous smile , “ but a country doctor , as you very astutely observed .\nI think that I am fairly justified in my inferences .\nAs to the adjectives , I said , if I remember right , amiable , unambitious , and absent-minded .\nIt is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who receives testimonials , only an unambitious one who abandons a London career for the country , and only an absent-minded one who leaves his stick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room . ”\n“ And the dog ? ”\n“ Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master .\nBeing a heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle , and the marks of his teeth are very plainly visible .\nThe dog ’s jaw , as shown in the space between these marks , is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not broad enough for a mastiff .\nIt may have been -- yes , by Jove , it is a curly-haired spaniel . ”\nHe had risen and paced the room as he spoke .\nNow he halted in the recess of the window .\nThere was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I glanced up in surprise .\n“ My dear fellow , how can you possibly be so sure of that ? ”\n“ For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very door-step , and there is the ring of its owner .\nDo n’t move , I beg you , Watson .\nHe is a professional brother of yours , and your presence may be of assistance to me .\nNow is the dramatic moment of fate , Watson , when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life , and you know not whether for good or ill .\nWhat does Dr. James Mortimer , the man of science , ask of Sherlock Holmes , the specialist in crime ?\nCome in ! ”\nThe appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me , since I had expected a typical country practitioner .\nHe was a very tall , thin man , with a long nose like a beak , which jutted out between two keen , gray eyes , set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of gold-rimmed glasses .\nHe was clad in a professional but rather slovenly fashion , for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed .\nThough young , his long back was already bowed , and he walked with a forward thrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence .\nAs he entered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes ’s hand , and he ran towards it with an exclamation of joy .\n“ I am so very glad , ” said he .\n“ I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office .\nI would not lose that stick for the world . ”\n",

    "— I — [ 1 ] Stately , plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead , bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed .\nA yellow dressinggown , ungirdled , was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air .\nHe held the bowl aloft and intoned : — Introibo ad altare Dei .\nHalted , he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely : — Come up , Kinch !\nCome up , you fearful jesuit !\nSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest .\nHe faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower , the surrounding land and the awaking mountains .\nThen , catching sight of Stephen Dedalus , he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air , gurgling in his throat and shaking his head .\nStephen Dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light untonsured hair , grained and hued like pale oak .\nBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly .\n— Back to barracks !\nhe said sternly .\nHe added in a preacher ’s tone : — For this , O dearly beloved , is the genuine Christine : body and soul and blood and ouns .\nSlow music , please .\nShut your eyes , gents .\nOne moment .\nA little trouble about those white corpuscles .\nSilence , all .\nHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call , then paused awhile in rapt attention , his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points .\nChrysostomos .\nTwo strong shrill whistles answered through the calm .\n— Thanks , old chap , he cried briskly .\nThat will do nicely .\nSwitch off the current , will you ?\nHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher , gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown .\nThe plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages .\nA pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips .\n— The mockery of it !\nhe said gaily .\nYour absurd name , an ancient Greek !\nHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet , laughing to himself .\nStephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck .\nBuck Mulligan ’s gay voice went on .\n— My name is absurd too : Malachi Mulligan , two dactyls .\nBut it has a Hellenic ring , has n’t it ?\nTripping and sunny like the buck himself .\nWe must go to Athens .\nWill you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ?\nHe laid the brush aside and , laughing with delight , cried : — Will he come ?\nThe jejune jesuit !\nCeasing , he began to shave with care .\n— Tell me , Mulligan , Stephen said quietly .\n— Yes , my love ?\n— How long is Haines going to stay in this tower ?\nBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder .\n— God , is n’t he dreadful ?\nhe said frankly .\nA ponderous Saxon .\nHe thinks you ’re not a gentleman .\nGod , these bloody English !\nBursting with money and indigestion .\nBecause he comes from Oxford .\nYou know , Dedalus , you have the real Oxford manner .\nHe ca n’t make you out .\nO , my name for you is the best : Kinch , the knife-blade .\nHe shaved warily over his chin .\n— He was raving all night about a black panther , Stephen said .\nWhere is his guncase ?\n— A woful lunatic !\nMulligan said .\nWere you in a funk ?\n— I was , Stephen said with energy and growing fear .\nOut here in the dark with a man I do n’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther .\nYou saved men from drowning .\nI ’m not a hero , however .\nIf he stays on here I am off .\nBuck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade .\nHe hopped down from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily .\n— Scutter !\nhe cried thickly .\nHe came over to the gunrest and , thrusting a hand into Stephen ’s upper pocket , said : — Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor .\nStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief .\nBuck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly .\nThen , gazing over the handkerchief , he said : — The bard ’s noserag !\nA new art colour for our Irish poets : snotgreen .\nYou can almost taste it , ca n’t you ?\nHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay , his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly .\n— God !\nhe said quietly .\nIs n’t the sea what Algy calls it : a great sweet mother ?\nThe snotgreen sea .\nThe scrotumtightening sea .\nEpi oinopa ponton .\nAh , Dedalus , the Greeks !\nI must teach you .\nYou must read them in the original .\nThalatta !\nThalatta !\nShe is our great sweet mother .\nCome and look .\nStephen stood up and went over to the parapet .\nLeaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown .\n— Our mighty mother !\nBuck Mulligan said .\nHe turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’s face .\n— The aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said .\nThat ’s why she wo n’t let me have anything to do with you .\n— Someone killed her , Stephen said gloomily .\n— You could have knelt down , damn it , Kinch , when your dying mother asked you , Buck Mulligan said .\nI ’m hyperborean as much as you .\nBut to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her .\nAnd you refused .\nThere is something sinister in you ... .\nHe broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek .\nA tolerant smile curled his lips .\n— But a lovely mummer !\nhe murmured to himself .\nKinch , the loveliest mummer of them all !\nHe shaved evenly and with care , in silence , seriously .\nStephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve .\nPain , that was not yet the pain of love , fretted his heart .\nSilently , in a dream she had come to him after her death , her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood , her breath , that had bent upon him , mute , reproachful , a faint odour of wetted ashes .\nAcross the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him .\nThe ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid .\nA bowl of white china had stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting .\nBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade .\n— Ah , poor dogsbody !\nhe said in a kind voice .\nI must give you a shirt and a few noserags .\nHow are the secondhand breeks ?\n— They fit well enough , Stephen answered .\nBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip .\n— The mockery of it , he said contentedly .\nSecondleg they should be .\nGod knows what poxy bowsy left them off .\nI have a lovely pair with a hair stripe , grey .\nYou ’ll look spiffing in them .\nI ’m not joking , Kinch .\nYou look damn well when you ’re dressed .\n— Thanks , Stephen said .\nI ca n’t wear them if they are grey .\n— He ca n’t wear them , Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror .\nEtiquette is etiquette .\nHe kills his mother but he ca n’t wear grey trousers .\nHe folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin .\nStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes .\n— That fellow I was with in the Ship last night , said Buck Mulligan , says you have g. p. i. He ’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman .\nGeneral paralysis of the insane !\nHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea .\nHis curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth .\nLaughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk .\n— Look at yourself , he said , you dreadful bard !\nStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack .\nHair on end .\nAs he and others see me .\nWho chose this face for me ?\nThis dogsbody to rid of vermin .\nIt asks me too .\n— I pinched it out of the skivvy ’s room , Buck Mulligan said .\nIt does her all right .\nThe aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi .\nLead him not into temptation .\nAnd her name is Ursula .\nLaughing again , he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’s peering eyes .\n— The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror , he said .\nIf Wilde were only alive to see you !\nDrawing back and pointing , Stephen said with bitterness : — It is a symbol of Irish art .\nThe cracked lookingglass of a servant .\nBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them .\n— It ’s not fair to tease you like that , Kinch , is it ?\nhe said kindly .\nGod knows you have more spirit than any of them .\nParried again .\nHe fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his .\nThe cold steel pen .\n— Cracked lookingglass of a servant !\nTell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea .\nHe ’s stinking with money and thinks you ’re not a gentleman .\nHis old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other .\nGod , Kinch , if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island .\nHellenise it .\nCranly ’s arm .\nHis arm .\n— And to think of your having to beg from these swine .\nI ’m the only one that knows what you are .\nWhy do n’t you trust me more ?\nWhat have you up your nose against me ?\nIs it Haines ?\nIf he makes any noise here I ’ll bring down Seymour and we ’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe .\n",

    "Chapter 1 Sir Walter Elliot , of Kellynch Hall , in Somersetshire , was a man who , for his own amusement , never took up any book but the Baronetage ; there he found occupation for an idle hour , and consolation in a distressed one ; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect , by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents ; there any unwelcome sensations , arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century ; and there , if every other leaf were powerless , he could read his own history with an interest which never failed .\nThis was the page at which the favourite volume always opened : \" ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL .\n\" Walter Elliot , born March 1 , 1760 , married , July 15 , 1784 , Elizabeth , daughter of James Stevenson , Esq. of South Park , in the county of Gloucester , by which lady ( who died 1800 ) he has issue Elizabeth , born June 1 , 1785 ; Anne , born August 9 , 1787 ; a still-born son , November 5 , 1789 ; Mary , born November 20 , 1791 . \"\nPrecisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer 's hands ; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding , for the information of himself and his family , these words , after the date of Mary 's birth -- \" Married , December 16 , 1810 , Charles , son and heir of Charles Musgrove , Esq. of Uppercross , in the county of Somerset , \" and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife .\nThen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family , in the usual terms ; how it had been first settled in Cheshire ; how mentioned in Dugdale , serving the office of high sheriff , representing a borough in three successive parliaments , exertions of loyalty , and dignity of baronet , in the first year of Charles II , with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married ; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages , and concluding with the arms and motto : -- \" Principal seat , Kellynch Hall , in the county of Somerset , \" and Sir Walter 's handwriting again in this finale : -- \" Heir presumptive , William Walter Elliot , Esq. , great grandson of the second Sir Walter . \"\nVanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot 's character ; vanity of person and of situation .\nHe had been remarkably handsome in his youth ; and , at fifty-four , was still a very fine man .\nFew women could think more of their personal appearance than he did , nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society .\nHe considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy ; and the Sir Walter Elliot , who united these gifts , was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion .\nHis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment ; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own .\nLady Elliot had been an excellent woman , sensible and amiable ; whose judgement and conduct , if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot , had never required indulgence afterwards .\n-- She had humoured , or softened , or concealed his failings , and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years ; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself , had found enough in her duties , her friends , and her children , to attach her to life , and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them .\n-- Three girls , the two eldest sixteen and fourteen , was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath , an awful charge rather , to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited , silly father .\nShe had , however , one very intimate friend , a sensible , deserving woman , who had been brought , by strong attachment to herself , to settle close by her , in the village of Kellynch ; and on her kindness and advice , Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters .\nThis friend , and Sir Walter , did not marry , whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance .\nThirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot 's death , and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends , and one remained a widower , the other a widow .\nThat Lady Russell , of steady age and character , and extremely well provided for , should have no thought of a second marriage , needs no apology to the public , which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again , than when she does not ; but Sir Walter 's continuing in singleness requires explanation .\nBe it known then , that Sir Walter , like a good father , ( having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications ) , prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters ' sake .\nFor one daughter , his eldest , he would really have given up any thing , which he had not been very much tempted to do .\nElizabeth had succeeded , at sixteen , to all that was possible , of her mother 's rights and consequence ; and being very handsome , and very like himself , her influence had always been great , and they had gone on together most happily .\nHis two other children were of very inferior value .\nMary had acquired a little artificial importance , by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove ; but Anne , with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character , which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding , was nobody with either father or sister ; her word had no weight , her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne .\nTo Lady Russell , indeed , she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter , favourite , and friend .\nLady Russell loved them all ; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again .\nA few years before , Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl , but her bloom had vanished early ; and as even in its height , her father had found little to admire in her , ( so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own ) , there could be nothing in them , now that she was faded and thin , to excite his esteem .\nHe had never indulged much hope , he had now none , of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work .\nAll equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth , for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune , and had therefore given all the honour and received none : Elizabeth would , one day or other , marry suitably .\nIt sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before ; and , generally speaking , if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety , it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost .\nIt was so with Elizabeth , still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago , and Sir Walter might be excused , therefore , in forgetting her age , or , at least , be deemed only half a fool , for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever , amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else ; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing .\nAnne haggard , Mary coarse , every face in the neighbourhood worsting , and the rapid increase of the crow 's foot about Lady Russell 's temples had long been a distress to him .\nElizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment .\nThirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall , presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was .\nFor thirteen years had she been doing the honours , and laying down the domestic law at home , and leading the way to the chaise and four , and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country .\nThirteen winters ' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded , and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms , as she travelled up to London with her father , for a few weeks ' annual enjoyment of the great world .\nShe had the remembrance of all this , she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions ; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever , but she felt her approach to the years of danger , and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two .\nThen might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth , but now she liked it not .\nAlways to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister , made the book an evil ; and more than once , when her father had left it open on the table near her , had she closed it , with averted eyes , and pushed it away .\nShe had had a disappointment , moreover , which that book , and especially the history of her own family , must ever present the remembrance of .\nThe heir presumptive , the very William Walter Elliot , Esq. , whose rights had been so generously supported by her father , had disappointed her .\nShe had , while a very young girl , as soon as she had known him to be , in the event of her having no brother , the future baronet , meant to marry him , and her father had always meant that she should .\nHe had not been known to them as a boy ; but soon after Lady Elliot 's death , Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance , and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth , he had persevered in seeking it , making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth ; and , in one of their spring excursions to London , when Elizabeth was in her first bloom , Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction .\nHe was at that time a very young man , just engaged in the study of the law ; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable , and every plan in his favour was confirmed .\nHe was invited to Kellynch Hall ; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year ; but he never came .\nThe following spring he was seen again in town , found equally agreeable , again encouraged , invited , and expected , and again he did not come ; and the next tidings were that he was married .\nInstead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot , he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth .\n",

    "PROLOGUE IT was 2 p.m. on the afternoon of May 7 , 1915 .\nThe _ Lusitania _ had been struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly , while the boats were being launched with all possible speed .\nThe women and children were being lined up awaiting their turn .\nSome still clung desperately to husbands and fathers ; others clutched their children closely to their breasts .\nOne girl stood alone , slightly apart from the rest .\nShe was quite young , not more than eighteen .\nShe did not seem afraid , and her grave , steadfast eyes looked straight ahead .\n“ I beg your pardon . ”\nA man ’s voice beside her made her start and turn .\nShe had noticed the speaker more than once amongst the first-class passengers .\nThere had been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination .\nHe spoke to no one .\nIf anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the overture .\nAlso he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a swift , suspicious glance .\nShe noticed now that he was greatly agitated .\nThere were beads of perspiration on his brow .\nHe was evidently in a state of overmastering fear .\nAnd yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be afraid to meet death !\n“ Yes ? ”\nHer grave eyes met his inquiringly .\nHe stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution .\n“ It must be ! ” he muttered to himself .\n“ Yes -- it is the only way . ”\nThen aloud he said abruptly : “ You are an American ? ”\n“ Yes . ”\n“ A patriotic one ? ”\nThe girl flushed .\n“ I guess you ’ve no right to ask such a thing !\nOf course I am ! ”\n“ Do n’t be offended .\nYou would n’t be if you knew how much there was at stake .\nBut I ’ve got to trust some one -- and it must be a woman . ”\n“ Why ? ”\n“ Because of ‘ women and children first .\n’” He looked round and lowered his voice .\n“ I ’m carrying papers -- vitally important papers .\nThey may make all the difference to the Allies in the war .\nYou understand ?\nThese papers have _ got _ to be saved !\nThey ’ve more chance with you than with me .\nWill you take them ? ”\nThe girl held out her hand .\n“ Wait -- I must warn you .\nThere may be a risk -- if I ’ve been followed .\nI do n’t think I have , but one never knows .\nIf so , there will be danger .\nHave you the nerve to go through with it ? ”\nThe girl smiled .\n“ I ’ll go through with it all right .\nAnd I ’m real proud to be chosen !\nWhat am I to do with them afterwards ? ”\n“ Watch the newspapers !\nI ’ll advertise in the personal column of the _ Times _ , beginning ‘ Shipmate . ’\nAt the end of three days if there ’s nothing -- well , you ’ll know I ’m down and out .\nThen take the packet to the American Embassy , and deliver it into the Ambassador ’s own hands .\nIs that clear ? ”\n“ Quite clear . ”\n“ Then be ready -- I ’m going to say good-bye . ”\nHe took her hand in his .\n“ Good-bye .\nGood luck to you , ” he said in a louder tone .\nHer hand closed on the oilskin packet that had lain in his palm .\nThe _ Lusitania _ settled with a more decided list to starboard .\nIn answer to a quick command , the girl went forward to take her place in the boat .\nCHAPTER I .\nTHE YOUNG ADVENTURERS , LTD .\n“ TOMMY , old thing ! ”\n“ Tuppence , old bean ! ”\nThe two young people greeted each other affectionately , and momentarily blocked the Dover Street Tube exit in doing so .\nThe adjective “ old ” was misleading .\nTheir united ages would certainly not have totalled forty-five .\n“ Not seen you for simply centuries , ” continued the young man .\n“ Where are you off to ?\nCome and chew a bun with me .\nWe ’re getting a bit unpopular here -- blocking the gangway as it were .\nLet ’s get out of it . ”\nThe girl assenting , they started walking down Dover Street towards Piccadilly .\n“ Now then , ” said Tommy , “ where shall we go ? ”\nThe very faint anxiety which underlay his tone did not escape the astute ears of Miss Prudence Cowley , known to her intimate friends for some mysterious reason as “ Tuppence . ”\nShe pounced at once .\n“ Tommy , you ’re stony ! ”\n“ Not a bit of it , ” declared Tommy unconvincingly .\n“ Rolling in cash . ”\n“ You always were a shocking liar , ” said Tuppence severely , “ though you did once persuade Sister Greenbank that the doctor had ordered you beer as a tonic , but forgotten to write it on the chart .\nDo you remember ? ”\nTommy chuckled .\n“ I should think I did !\nWas n’t the old cat in a rage when she found out ?\nNot that she was a bad sort really , old Mother Greenbank !\nGood old hospital -- demobbed like everything else , I suppose ? ”\nTuppence sighed .\n“ Yes .\nYou too ? ”\nTommy nodded .\n“ Two months ago . ”\n“ Gratuity ? ” hinted Tuppence .\n“ Spent . ”\n“ Oh , Tommy ! ”\n“ No , old thing , not in riotous dissipation .\nNo such luck !\nThe cost of living -- ordinary plain , or garden living nowadays is , I assure you , if you do not know ---- ” “ My dear child , ” interrupted Tuppence , “ there is nothing I do _ not _ know about the cost of living .\nHere we are at Lyons ’ , and we will each of us pay for our own .\nThat ’s it ! ”\nAnd Tuppence led the way upstairs .\nThe place was full , and they wandered about looking for a table , catching odds and ends of conversation as they did so .\n“ And -- do you know , she sat down and _ cried _ when I told her she could n’t have the flat after all . ”\n“ It was simply a _ bargain _ , my dear !\nJust like the one Mabel Lewis brought from Paris ---- ” “ Funny scraps one does overhear , ” murmured Tommy .\n“ I passed two Johnnies in the street to-day talking about some one called Jane Finn .\nDid you ever hear such a name ? ”\nBut at that moment two elderly ladies rose and collected parcels , and Tuppence deftly ensconced herself in one of the vacant seats .\nTommy ordered tea and buns .\nTuppence ordered tea and buttered toast .\n“ And mind the tea comes in separate teapots , ” she added severely .\nTommy sat down opposite her .\nHis bared head revealed a shock of exquisitely slicked-back red hair .\nHis face was pleasantly ugly -- nondescript , yet unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman .\nHis brown suit was well cut , but perilously near the end of its tether .\nThey were an essentially modern-looking couple as they sat there .\nTuppence had no claim to beauty , but there was character and charm in the elfin lines of her little face , with its determined chin and large , wide-apart grey eyes that looked mistily out from under straight , black brows .\nShe wore a small bright green toque over her black bobbed hair , and her extremely short and rather shabby skirt revealed a pair of uncommonly dainty ankles .\nHer appearance presented a valiant attempt at smartness .\nThe tea came at last , and Tuppence , rousing herself from a fit of meditation , poured it out .\n“ Now then , ” said Tommy , taking a large bite of bun , “ let ’s get up-to-date .\nRemember , I have n’t seen you since that time in hospital in 1916 . ”\n“ Very well . ”\nTuppence helped herself liberally to buttered toast .\n“ Abridged biography of Miss Prudence Cowley , fifth daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of Little Missendell , Suffolk .\nMiss Cowley left the delights ( and drudgeries ) of her home life early in the war and came up to London , where she entered an officers ’ hospital .\nFirst month : Washed up six hundred and forty-eight plates every day .\nSecond month : Promoted to drying aforesaid plates .\nThird month : Promoted to peeling potatoes .\nFourth month : Promoted to cutting bread and butter .\nFifth month : Promoted one floor up to duties of wardmaid with mop and pail .\nSixth month : Promoted to waiting at table .\nSeventh month : Pleasing appearance and nice manners so striking that am promoted to waiting on the Sisters !\nEighth month : Slight check in career .\nSister Bond ate Sister Westhaven ’s egg !\nGrand row !\nWardmaid clearly to blame !\nInattention in such important matters can not be too highly censured .\nMop and pail again !\nHow are the mighty fallen !\nNinth month : Promoted to sweeping out wards , where I found a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford ( bow , Tommy ! )\n, whom I had not seen for five long years .\nThe meeting was affecting !\nTenth month : Reproved by matron for visiting the pictures in company with one of the patients , namely : the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford .\nEleventh and twelfth months : Parlourmaid duties resumed with entire success .\nAt the end of the year left hospital in a blaze of glory .\nAfter that , the talented Miss Cowley drove successively a trade delivery van , a motor-lorry and a general !\nThe last was the pleasantest .\nHe was quite a young general ! ”\n“ What blighter was that ? ” inquired Tommy .\n“ Perfectly sickening the way those brass hats drove from the War Office to the _ Savoy _ , and from the _ Savoy _ to the War Office ! ”\n“ I ’ve forgotten his name now , ” confessed Tuppence .\n“ To resume , that was in a way the apex of my career .\nI next entered a Government office .\nWe had several very enjoyable tea parties .\nI had intended to become a land girl , a postwoman , and a bus conductress by way of rounding off my career -- but the Armistice intervened !\nI clung to the office with the true limpet touch for many long months , but , alas , I was combed out at last .\nSince then I ’ve been looking for a job .\nNow then -- your turn . ”\n“ There ’s not so much promotion in mine , ” said Tommy regretfully , “ and a great deal less variety .\nI went out to France again , as you know .\nThen they sent me to Mesopotamia , and I got wounded for the second time , and went into hospital out there .\nThen I got stuck in Egypt till the Armistice happened , kicked my heels there some time longer , and , as I told you , finally got demobbed .\nAnd , for ten long , weary months I ’ve been job hunting !\nThere are n’t any jobs !\nAnd , if there were , they would n’t give ‘ em to me .\nWhat good am I ?\nWhat do I know about business ?\nNothing . ”\n",

    "CHAPTER 1 The Rassendylls -- With a Word on the Elphbergs “ I wonder when in the world you ’re going to do anything , Rudolf ? ” said my brother ’s wife .\n“ My dear Rose , ” I answered , laying down my egg-spoon , “ why in the world should I do anything ?\nMy position is a comfortable one .\nI have an income nearly sufficient for my wants ( no one ’s income is ever quite sufficient , you know ) , I enjoy an enviable social position : I am brother to Lord Burlesdon , and brother-in-law to that charming lady , his countess .\nBehold , it is enough ! ”\n“ You are nine-and-twenty , ” she observed , “ and you ’ve done nothing but -- ” “ Knock about ?\nIt is true .\nOur family does n’t need to do things . ”\nThis remark of mine rather annoyed Rose , for everybody knows ( and therefore there can be no harm in referring to the fact ) that , pretty and accomplished as she herself is , her family is hardly of the same standing as the Rassendylls .\nBesides her attractions , she possessed a large fortune , and my brother Robert was wise enough not to mind about her ancestry .\nAncestry is , in fact , a matter concerning which the next observation of Rose ’s has some truth .\n“ Good families are generally worse than any others , ” she said .\nUpon this I stroked my hair : I knew quite well what she meant .\n“ I ’m so glad Robert ’s is black ! ” she cried .\nAt this moment Robert ( who rises at seven and works before breakfast ) came in .\nHe glanced at his wife : her cheek was slightly flushed ; he patted it caressingly .\n“ What ’s the matter , my dear ? ” he asked .\n“ She objects to my doing nothing and having red hair , ” said I , in an injured tone .\n“ Oh !\nof course he ca n’t help his hair , ” admitted Rose .\n“ It generally crops out once in a generation , ” said my brother .\n“ So does the nose .\nRudolf has got them both . ”\n“ I wish they did n’t crop out , ” said Rose , still flushed .\n“ I rather like them myself , ” said I , and , rising , I bowed to the portrait of Countess Amelia .\nMy brother ’s wife uttered an exclamation of impatience .\n“ I wish you ’d take that picture away , Robert , ” said she .\n“ My dear ! ” he cried .\n“ Good heavens ! ”\nI added .\n“ Then it might be forgotten , ” she continued .\n“ Hardly -- with Rudolf about , ” said Robert , shaking his head .\n“ Why should it be forgotten ? ”\nI asked .\n“ Rudolf ! ” exclaimed my brother ’s wife , blushing very prettily .\nI laughed , and went on with my egg .\nAt least I had shelved the question of what ( if anything ) I ought to do .\nAnd , by way of closing the discussion -- and also , I must admit , of exasperating my strict little sister-in-law a trifle more -- I observed : “ I rather like being an Elphberg myself . ”\nWhen I read a story , I skip the explanations ; yet the moment I begin to write one , I find that I must have an explanation .\nFor it is manifest that I must explain why my sister-in-law was vexed with my nose and hair , and why I ventured to call myself an Elphberg .\nFor eminent as , I must protest , the Rassendylls have been for many generations , yet participation in their blood of course does not , at first sight , justify the boast of a connection with the grander stock of the Elphbergs or a claim to be one of that Royal House .\nFor what relationship is there between Ruritania and Burlesdon , between the Palace at Strelsau or the Castle of Zenda and Number 305 Park Lane , W. ?\nWell then -- and I must premise that I am going , perforce , to rake up the very scandal which my dear Lady Burlesdon wishes forgotten -- in the year 1733 , George II .\nsitting then on the throne , peace reigning for the moment , and the King and the Prince of Wales being not yet at loggerheads , there came on a visit to the English Court a certain prince , who was afterwards known to history as Rudolf the Third of Ruritania .\nThe prince was a tall , handsome young fellow , marked ( maybe marred , it is not for me to say ) by a somewhat unusually long , sharp and straight nose , and a mass of dark-red hair -- in fact , the nose and the hair which have stamped the Elphbergs time out of mind .\nHe stayed some months in England , where he was most courteously received ; yet , in the end , he left rather under a cloud .\nFor he fought a duel ( it was considered highly well bred of him to waive all question of his rank ) with a nobleman , well known in the society of the day , not only for his own merits , but as the husband of a very beautiful wife .\nIn that duel Prince Rudolf received a severe wound , and , recovering therefrom , was adroitly smuggled off by the Ruritanian ambassador , who had found him a pretty handful .\nThe nobleman was not wounded in the duel ; but the morning being raw and damp on the occasion of the meeting , he contracted a severe chill , and , failing to throw it off , he died some six months after the departure of Prince Rudolf , without having found leisure to adjust his relations with his wife -- who , after another two months , bore an heir to the title and estates of the family of Burlesdon .\nThis lady was the Countess Amelia , whose picture my sister-in-law wished to remove from the drawing-room in Park Lane ; and her husband was James , fifth Earl of Burlesdon and twenty-second Baron Rassendyll , both in the peerage of England , and a Knight of the Garter .\nAs for Rudolf , he went back to Ruritania , married a wife , and ascended the throne , whereon his progeny in the direct line have sat from then till this very hour -- with one short interval .\nAnd , finally , if you walk through the picture galleries at Burlesdon , among the fifty portraits or so of the last century and a half , you will find five or six , including that of the sixth earl , distinguished by long , sharp , straight noses and a quantity of dark-red hair ; these five or six have also blue eyes , whereas among the Rassendylls dark eyes are the commoner .\nThat is the explanation , and I am glad to have finished it : the blemishes on honourable lineage are a delicate subject , and certainly this heredity we hear so much about is the finest scandalmonger in the world ; it laughs at discretion , and writes strange entries between the lines of the “ Peerages ” .\nIt will be observed that my sister-in-law , with a want of logic that must have been peculiar to herself ( since we are no longer allowed to lay it to the charge of her sex ) , treated my complexion almost as an offence for which I was responsible , hastening to assume from that external sign inward qualities of which I protest my entire innocence ; and this unjust inference she sought to buttress by pointing to the uselessness of the life I had led .\nWell , be that as it may , I had picked up a good deal of pleasure and a good deal of knowledge .\nI had been to a German school and a German university , and spoke German as readily and perfectly as English ; I was thoroughly at home in French ; I had a smattering of Italian and enough Spanish to swear by .\nI was , I believe , a strong , though hardly fine swordsman and a good shot .\nI could ride anything that had a back to sit on ; and my head was as cool a one as you could find , for all its flaming cover .\nIf you say that I ought to have spent my time in useful labour , I am out of Court and have nothing to say , save that my parents had no business to leave me two thousand pounds a year and a roving disposition .\n“ The difference between you and Robert , ” said my sister-in-law , who often ( bless her ! )\nspeaks on a platform , and oftener still as if she were on one , “ is that he recognizes the duties of his position , and you see the opportunities of yours . ”\n“ To a man of spirit , my dear Rose , ” I answered , “ opportunities are duties . ”\n“ Nonsense ! ” said she , tossing her head ; and after a moment she went on : “ Now , here ’s Sir Jacob Borrodaile offering you exactly what you might be equal to . ”\n“ A thousand thanks ! ”\nI murmured .\n“ He ’s to have an Embassy in six months , and Robert says he is sure that he ’ll take you as an attache .\nDo take it , Rudolf -- to please me . ”\nNow , when my sister-in-law puts the matter in that way , wrinkling her pretty brows , twisting her little hands , and growing wistful in the eyes , all on account of an idle scamp like myself , for whom she has no natural responsibility , I am visited with compunction .\nMoreover , I thought it possible that I could pass the time in the position suggested with some tolerable amusement .\nTherefore I said : “ My dear sister , if in six months ’ time no unforeseen obstacle has arisen , and Sir Jacob invites me , hang me if I do n’t go with Sir Jacob ! ”\n“ Oh , Rudolf , how good of you !\nI am glad ! ”\n“ Where ’s he going to ? ”\n“ He does n’t know yet ; but it ’s sure to be a good Embassy . ”\n“ Madame , ” said I , “ for your sake I ’ll go , if it ’s no more than a beggarly Legation .\nWhen I do a thing , I do n’t do it by halves . ”\nMy promise , then , was given ; but six months are six months , and seem an eternity , and , inasmuch as they stretched between me and my prospective industry ( I suppose attaches are industrious ; but I know not , for I never became attache to Sir Jacob or anybody else ) , I cast about for some desirable mode of spending them .\nAnd it occurred to me suddenly that I would visit Ruritania .\nIt may seem strange that I had never visited that country yet ; but my father ( in spite of a sneaking fondness for the Elphbergs , which led him to give me , his second son , the famous Elphberg name of Rudolf ) had always been averse from my going , and , since his death , my brother , prompted by Rose , had accepted the family tradition which taught that a wide berth was to be given to that country .\nBut the moment Ruritania had come into my head I was eaten up with a curiosity to see it .\nAfter all , red hair and long noses are not confined to the House of Elphberg , and the old story seemed a preposterously insufficient reason for debarring myself from acquaintance with a highly interesting and important kingdom , one which had played no small part in European history , and might do the like again under the sway of a young and vigorous ruler , such as the new King was rumoured to be .\nMy determination was clinched by reading in _ The Times _ that Rudolf the Fifth was to be crowned at Strelsau in the course of the next three weeks , and that great magnificence was to mark the occasion .\nAt once I made up my mind to be present , and began my preparations .\nBut , inasmuch as it has never been my practice to furnish my relatives with an itinerary of my journeys and in this case I anticipated opposition to my wishes , I gave out that I was going for a ramble in the Tyrol -- an old haunt of mine -- and propitiated Rose ’s wrath by declaring that I intended to study the political and social problems of the interesting community which dwells in that neighbourhood .\n",

    "CHAPTER I .\nTHE TWO POETS OF SAFFRON PARK THE suburb of Saffron Park lay on the sunset side of London , as red and ragged as a cloud of sunset .\nIt was built of a bright brick throughout ; its sky-line was fantastic , and even its ground plan was wild .\nIt had been the outburst of a speculative builder , faintly tinged with art , who called its architecture sometimes Elizabethan and sometimes Queen Anne , apparently under the impression that the two sovereigns were identical .\nIt was described with some justice as an artistic colony , though it never in any definable way produced any art .\nBut although its pretensions to be an intellectual centre were a little vague , its pretensions to be a pleasant place were quite indisputable .\nThe stranger who looked for the first time at the quaint red houses could only think how very oddly shaped the people must be who could fit in to them .\nNor when he met the people was he disappointed in this respect .\nThe place was not only pleasant , but perfect , if once he could regard it not as a deception but rather as a dream .\nEven if the people were not “ artists , ” the whole was nevertheless artistic .\nThat young man with the long , auburn hair and the impudent face -- that young man was not really a poet ; but surely he was a poem .\nThat old gentleman with the wild , white beard and the wild , white hat -- that venerable humbug was not really a philosopher ; but at least he was the cause of philosophy in others .\nThat scientific gentleman with the bald , egg-like head and the bare , bird-like neck had no real right to the airs of science that he assumed .\nHe had not discovered anything new in biology ; but what biological creature could he have discovered more singular than himself ?\nThus , and thus only , the whole place had properly to be regarded ; it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists , but as a frail but finished work of art .\nA man who stepped into its social atmosphere felt as if he had stepped into a written comedy .\nMore especially this attractive unreality fell upon it about nightfall , when the extravagant roofs were dark against the afterglow and the whole insane village seemed as separate as a drifting cloud .\nThis again was more strongly true of the many nights of local festivity , when the little gardens were often illuminated , and the big Chinese lanterns glowed in the dwarfish trees like some fierce and monstrous fruit .\nAnd this was strongest of all on one particular evening , still vaguely remembered in the locality , of which the auburn-haired poet was the hero .\nIt was not by any means the only evening of which he was the hero .\nOn many nights those passing by his little back garden might hear his high , didactic voice laying down the law to men and particularly to women .\nThe attitude of women in such cases was indeed one of the paradoxes of the place .\nMost of the women were of the kind vaguely called emancipated , and professed some protest against male supremacy .\nYet these new women would always pay to a man the extravagant compliment which no ordinary woman ever pays to him , that of listening while he is talking .\nAnd Mr. Lucian Gregory , the red-haired poet , was really ( in some sense ) a man worth listening to , even if one only laughed at the end of it .\nHe put the old cant of the lawlessness of art and the art of lawlessness with a certain impudent freshness which gave at least a momentary pleasure .\nHe was helped in some degree by the arresting oddity of his appearance , which he worked , as the phrase goes , for all it was worth .\nHis dark red hair parted in the middle was literally like a woman ’s , and curved into the slow curls of a virgin in a pre-Raphaelite picture .\nFrom within this almost saintly oval , however , his face projected suddenly broad and brutal , the chin carried forward with a look of cockney contempt .\nThis combination at once tickled and terrified the nerves of a neurotic population .\nHe seemed like a walking blasphemy , a blend of the angel and the ape .\nThis particular evening , if it is remembered for nothing else , will be remembered in that place for its strange sunset .\nIt looked like the end of the world .\nAll the heaven seemed covered with a quite vivid and palpable plumage ; you could only say that the sky was full of feathers , and of feathers that almost brushed the face .\nAcross the great part of the dome they were grey , with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green ; but towards the west the whole grew past description , transparent and passionate , and the last red-hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen .\nThe whole was so close about the earth , as to express nothing but a violent secrecy .\nThe very empyrean seemed to be a secret .\nIt expressed that splendid smallness which is the soul of local patriotism .\nThe very sky seemed small .\nI say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening if only by that oppressive sky .\nThere are others who may remember it because it marked the first appearance in the place of the second poet of Saffron Park .\nFor a long time the red-haired revolutionary had reigned without a rival ; it was upon the night of the sunset that his solitude suddenly ended .\nThe new poet , who introduced himself by the name of Gabriel Syme was a very mild-looking mortal , with a fair , pointed beard and faint , yellow hair .\nBut an impression grew that he was less meek than he looked .\nHe signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet , Gregory , upon the whole nature of poetry .\nHe said that he ( Syme ) was poet of law , a poet of order ; nay , he said he was a poet of respectability .\nSo all the Saffron Parkers looked at him as if he had that moment fallen out of that impossible sky .\nIn fact , Mr. Lucian Gregory , the anarchic poet , connected the two events .\n“ It may well be , ” he said , in his sudden lyrical manner , “ it may well be on such a night of clouds and cruel colours that there is brought forth upon the earth such a portent as a respectable poet .\nYou say you are a poet of law ; I say you are a contradiction in terms .\nI only wonder there were not comets and earthquakes on the night you appeared in this garden . ”\nThe man with the meek blue eyes and the pale , pointed beard endured these thunders with a certain submissive solemnity .\nThe third party of the group , Gregory ’s sister Rosamond , who had her brother ’s braids of red hair , but a kindlier face underneath them , laughed with such mixture of admiration and disapproval as she gave commonly to the family oracle .\nGregory resumed in high oratorical good humour .\n“ An artist is identical with an anarchist , ” he cried .\n“ You might transpose the words anywhere .\nAn anarchist is an artist .\nThe man who throws a bomb is an artist , because he prefers a great moment to everything .\nHe sees how much more valuable is one burst of blazing light , one peal of perfect thunder , than the mere common bodies of a few shapeless policemen .\nAn artist disregards all governments , abolishes all conventions .\nThe poet delights in disorder only .\nIf it were not so , the most poetical thing in the world would be the Underground Railway . ”\n“ So it is , ” said Mr. Syme .\n“ Nonsense ! ” said Gregory , who was very rational when anyone else attempted paradox .\n“ Why do all the clerks and navvies in the railway trains look so sad and tired , so very sad and tired ?\nI will tell you .\nIt is because they know that the train is going right .\nIt is because they know that whatever place they have taken a ticket for that place they will reach .\nIt is because after they have passed Sloane Square they know that the next station must be Victoria , and nothing but Victoria .\nOh , their wild rapture !\noh , their eyes like stars and their souls again in Eden , if the next station were unaccountably Baker Street ! ”\n“ It is you who are unpoetical , ” replied the poet Syme .\n“ If what you say of clerks is true , they can only be as prosaic as your poetry .\nThe rare , strange thing is to hit the mark ; the gross , obvious thing is to miss it .\nWe feel it is epical when man with one wild arrow strikes a distant bird .\nIs it not also epical when man with one wild engine strikes a distant station ?\nChaos is dull ; because in chaos the train might indeed go anywhere , to Baker Street or to Bagdad .\nBut man is a magician , and his whole magic is in this , that he does say Victoria , and lo !\nit is Victoria .\nNo , take your books of mere poetry and prose ; let me read a time table , with tears of pride .\nTake your Byron , who commemorates the defeats of man ; give me Bradshaw , who commemorates his victories .\nGive me Bradshaw , I say ! ”\n“ Must you go ? ” inquired Gregory sarcastically .\n“ I tell you , ” went on Syme with passion , “ that every time a train comes in I feel that it has broken past batteries of besiegers , and that man has won a battle against chaos .\nYou say contemptuously that when one has left Sloane Square one must come to Victoria .\nI say that one might do a thousand things instead , and that whenever I really come there I have the sense of hairbreadth escape .\nAnd when I hear the guard shout out the word ‘ Victoria , ’ it is not an unmeaning word .\nIt is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest .\nIt is to me indeed ‘ Victoria ’ ; it is the victory of Adam . ”\nGregory wagged his heavy , red head with a slow and sad smile .\n“ And even then , ” he said , “ we poets always ask the question , ‘ And what is Victoria now that you have got there ? ’\nYou think Victoria is like the New Jerusalem .\nWe know that the New Jerusalem will only be like Victoria .\nYes , the poet will be discontented even in the streets of heaven .\nThe poet is always in revolt . ”\n“ There again , ” said Syme irritably , “ what is there poetical about being in revolt ?\nYou might as well say that it is poetical to be sea-sick .\nBeing sick is a revolt .\nBoth being sick and being rebellious may be the wholesome thing on certain desperate occasions ; but I ’m hanged if I can see why they are poetical .\nRevolt in the abstract is -- revolting .\nIt ’s mere vomiting . ”\n",

    "CHAPTER I PARIS : SEPTEMBER , 1792 A surging , seething , murmuring crowd of beings that are human only in name , for to the eye and ear they seem naught but savage creatures , animated by vile passions and by the lust of vengeance and of hate .\nThe hour , some little time before sunset , and the place , the West Barricade , at the very spot where , a decade later , a proud tyrant raised an undying monument to the nation 's glory and his own vanity .\nDuring the greater part of the day the guillotine had been kept busy at its ghastly work : all that France had boasted of in the past centuries , of ancient names , and blue blood , had paid toll to her desire for liberty and for fraternity .\nThe carnage had only ceased at this late hour of the day because there were other more interesting sights for the people to witness , a little while before the final closing of the barricades for the night .\nAnd so the crowd rushed away from the Place de la Greve and made for the various barricades in order to watch this interesting and amusing sight .\nIt was to be seen every day , for those aristos were such fools !\nThey were traitors to the people of course , all of them , men , women , and children , who happened to be descendants of the great men who since the Crusades had made the glory of France : her old NOBLESSE .\nTheir ancestors had oppressed the people , had crushed them under the scarlet heels of their dainty buckled shoes , and now the people had become the rulers of France and crushed their former masters -- not beneath their heel , for they went shoeless mostly in these days -- but a more effectual weight , the knife of the guillotine .\nAnd daily , hourly , the hideous instrument of torture claimed its many victims -- old men , young women , tiny children until the day when it would finally demand the head of a King and of a beautiful young Queen .\nBut this was as it should be : were not the people now the rulers of France ?\nEvery aristocrat was a traitor , as his ancestors had been before him : for two hundred years now the people had sweated , and toiled , and starved , to keep a lustful court in lavish extravagance ; now the descendants of those who had helped to make those courts brilliant had to hide for their lives -- to fly , if they wished to avoid the tardy vengeance of the people .\nAnd they did try to hide , and tried to fly : that was just the fun of the whole thing .\nEvery afternoon before the gates closed and the market carts went out in procession by the various barricades , some fool of an aristo endeavoured to evade the clutches of the Committee of Public Safety .\nIn various disguises , under various pretexts , they tried to slip through the barriers , which were so well guarded by citizen soldiers of the Republic .\nMen in women 's clothes , women in male attire , children disguised in beggars ' rags : there were some of all sorts : CI-DEVANT counts , marquises , even dukes , who wanted to fly from France , reach England or some other equally accursed country , and there try to rouse foreign feelings against the glorious Revolution , or to raise an army in order to liberate the wretched prisoners in the Temple , who had once called themselves sovereigns of France .\nBut they were nearly always caught at the barricades , Sergeant Bibot especially at the West Gate had a wonderful nose for scenting an aristo in the most perfect disguise .\nThen , of course , the fun began .\nBibot would look at his prey as a cat looks upon the mouse , play with him , sometimes for quite a quarter of an hour , pretend to be hoodwinked by the disguise , by the wigs and other bits of theatrical make-up which hid the identity of a CI-DEVANT noble marquise or count .\nOh !\nBibot had a keen sense of humour , and it was well worth hanging round that West Barricade , in order to see him catch an aristo in the very act of trying to flee from the vengeance of the people .\nSometimes Bibot would let his prey actually out by the gates , allowing him to think for the space of two minutes at least that he really had escaped out of Paris , and might even manage to reach the coast of England in safety , but Bibot would let the unfortunate wretch walk about ten metres towards the open country , then he would send two men after him and bring him back , stripped of his disguise .\nOh !\nthat was extremely funny , for as often as not the fugitive would prove to be a woman , some proud marchioness , who looked terribly comical when she found herself in Bibot 's clutches after all , and knew that a summary trial would await her the next day and after that , the fond embrace of Madame la Guillotine .\nNo wonder that on this fine afternoon in September the crowd round Bibot 's gate was eager and excited .\nThe lust of blood grows with its satisfaction , there is no satiety : the crowd had seen a hundred noble heads fall beneath the guillotine to-day , it wanted to make sure that it would see another hundred fall on the morrow .\nBibot was sitting on an overturned and empty cask close by the gate of the barricade ; a small detachment of citoyen soldiers was under his command .\nThe work had been very hot lately .\nThose cursed aristos were becoming terrified and tried their hardest to slip out of Paris : men , women and children , whose ancestors , even in remote ages , had served those traitorous Bourbons , were all traitors themselves and right food for the guillotine .\nEvery day Bibot had had the satisfaction of unmasking some fugitive royalists and sending them back to be tried by the Committee of Public Safety , presided over by that good patriot , Citoyen Foucquier-Tinville .\nRobespierre and Danton both had commended Bibot for his zeal and Bibot was proud of the fact that he on his own initiative had sent at least fifty aristos to the guillotine .\nBut to-day all the sergeants in command at the various barricades had had special orders .\nRecently a very great number of aristos had succeeded in escaping out of France and in reaching England safely .\nThere were curious rumours about these escapes ; they had become very frequent and singularly daring ; the people 's minds were becoming strangely excited about it all .\nSergeant Grospierre had been sent to the guillotine for allowing a whole family of aristos to slip out of the North Gate under his very nose .\nIt was asserted that these escapes were organised by a band of Englishmen , whose daring seemed to be unparalleled , and who , from sheer desire to meddle in what did not concern them , spent their spare time in snatching away lawful victims destined for Madame la Guillotine .\nThese rumours soon grew in extravagance ; there was no doubt that this band of meddlesome Englishmen did exist ; moreover , they seemed to be under the leadership of a man whose pluck and audacity were almost fabulous .\nStrange stories were afloat of how he and those aristos whom he rescued became suddenly invisible as they reached the barricades and escaped out of the gates by sheer supernatural agency .\nNo one had seen these mysterious Englishmen ; as for their leader , he was never spoken of , save with a superstitious shudder .\nCitoyen Foucquier-Tinville would in the course of the day receive a scrap of paper from some mysterious source ; sometimes he would find it in the pocket of his coat , at others it would be handed to him by someone in the crowd , whilst he was on his way to the sitting of the Committee of Public Safety .\nThe paper always contained a brief notice that the band of meddlesome Englishmen were at work , and it was always signed with a device drawn in red -- a little star-shaped flower , which we in England call the Scarlet Pimpernel .\nWithin a few hours of the receipt of this impudent notice , the citoyens of the Committee of Public Safety would hear that so many royalists and aristocrats had succeeded in reaching the coast , and were on their way to England and safety .\nThe guards at the gates had been doubled , the sergeants in command had been threatened with death , whilst liberal rewards were offered for the capture of these daring and impudent Englishmen .\nThere was a sum of five thousand francs promised to the man who laid hands on the mysterious and elusive Scarlet Pimpernel .\nEveryone felt that Bibot would be that man , and Bibot allowed that belief to take firm root in everybody 's mind ; and so , day after day , people came to watch him at the West Gate , so as to be present when he laid hands on any fugitive aristo who perhaps might be accompanied by that mysterious Englishman .\n“ Bah ! ” he said to his trusted corporal , “ Citoyen Grospierre was a fool !\nHad it been me now , at that North Gate last week . . . ” Citoyen Bibot spat on the ground to express his contempt for his comrade 's stupidity .\n“ How did it happen , citoyen ? ” asked the corporal .\n“ Grospierre was at the gate , keeping good watch , ” began Bibot , pompously , as the crowd closed in round him , listening eagerly to his narrative .\n“ We 've all heard of this meddlesome Englishman , this accursed Scarlet Pimpernel .\nHe wo n't get through MY gate , MORBLEU !\nunless he be the devil himself .\nBut Grospierre was a fool .\nThe market carts were going through the gates ; there was one laden with casks , and driven by an old man , with a boy beside him .\nGrospierre was a bit drunk , but he thought himself very clever ; he looked into the casks -- most of them , at least -- and saw they were empty , and let the cart go through . ”\nA murmur of wrath and contempt went round the group of ill-clad wretches , who crowded round Citoyen Bibot .\n“ Half an hour later , ” continued the sergeant , “ up comes a captain of the guard with a squad of some dozen soldiers with him .\n' Has a cart gone through ? '\nhe asks of Grospierre , breathlessly .\n' Yes , ' says Grospierre , ' not half an hour ago . '\n' And you have let them escape , ' shouts the captain furiously .\n' You 'll go to the guillotine for this , citoyen sergeant !\nthat cart held concealed the CI-DEVANT Duc de Chalis and all his family ! '\n' What ! '\nthunders Grospierre , aghast .\n' Aye !\nand the driver was none other than that cursed Englishman , the Scarlet Pimpernel . ' ”\nA howl of execration greeted this tale .\nCitoyen Grospierre had paid for his blunder on the guillotine , but what a fool !\noh !\nwhat a fool !\n",

    "CHAPTER I ON THE ARIZONA HILLS I am a very old man ; how old I do not know .\nPossibly I am a hundred , possibly more ; but I can not tell because I have never aged as other men , nor do I remember any childhood .\nSo far as I can recollect I have always been a man , a man of about thirty .\nI appear today as I did forty years and more ago , and yet I feel that I can not go on living forever ; that some day I shall die the real death from which there is no resurrection .\nI do not know why I should fear death , I who have died twice and am still alive ; but yet I have the same horror of it as you who have never died , and it is because of this terror of death , I believe , that I am so convinced of my mortality .\nAnd because of this conviction I have determined to write down the story of the interesting periods of my life and of my death .\nI can not explain the phenomena ; I can only set down here in the words of an ordinary soldier of fortune a chronicle of the strange events that befell me during the ten years that my dead body lay undiscovered in an Arizona cave .\nI have never told this story , nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until after I have passed over for eternity .\nI know that the average human mind will not believe what it can not grasp , and so I do not purpose being pilloried by the public , the pulpit , and the press , and held up as a colossal liar when I am but telling the simple truths which some day science will substantiate .\nPossibly the suggestions which I gained upon Mars , and the knowledge which I can set down in this chronicle , will aid in an earlier understanding of the mysteries of our sister planet ; mysteries to you , but no longer mysteries to me .\nMy name is John Carter ; I am better known as Captain Jack Carter of Virginia .\nAt the close of the Civil War I found myself possessed of several hundred thousand dollars ( Confederate ) and a captain 's commission in the cavalry arm of an army which no longer existed ; the servant of a state which had vanished with the hopes of the South .\nMasterless , penniless , and with my only means of livelihood , fighting , gone , I determined to work my way to the southwest and attempt to retrieve my fallen fortunes in a search for gold .\nI spent nearly a year prospecting in company with another Confederate officer , Captain James K. Powell of Richmond .\nWe were extremely fortunate , for late in the winter of 1865 , after many hardships and privations , we located the most remarkable gold-bearing quartz vein that our wildest dreams had ever pictured .\nPowell , who was a mining engineer by education , stated that we had uncovered over a million dollars worth of ore in a trifle over three months .\nAs our equipment was crude in the extreme we decided that one of us must return to civilization , purchase the necessary machinery and return with a sufficient force of men properly to work the mine .\nAs Powell was familiar with the country , as well as with the mechanical requirements of mining we determined that it would be best for him to make the trip .\nIt was agreed that I was to hold down our claim against the remote possibility of its being jumped by some wandering prospector .\nOn March 3 , 1866 , Powell and I packed his provisions on two of our burros , and bidding me good-bye he mounted his horse , and started down the mountainside toward the valley , across which led the first stage of his journey .\nThe morning of Powell 's departure was , like nearly all Arizona mornings , clear and beautiful ; I could see him and his little pack animals picking their way down the mountainside toward the valley , and all during the morning I would catch occasional glimpses of them as they topped a hog back or came out upon a level plateau .\nMy last sight of Powell was about three in the afternoon as he entered the shadows of the range on the opposite side of the valley .\nSome half hour later I happened to glance casually across the valley and was much surprised to note three little dots in about the same place I had last seen my friend and his two pack animals .\nI am not given to needless worrying , but the more I tried to convince myself that all was well with Powell , and that the dots I had seen on his trail were antelope or wild horses , the less I was able to assure myself .\nSince we had entered the territory we had not seen a hostile Indian , and we had , therefore , become careless in the extreme , and were wont to ridicule the stories we had heard of the great numbers of these vicious marauders that were supposed to haunt the trails , taking their toll in lives and torture of every white party which fell into their merciless clutches .\nPowell , I knew , was well armed and , further , an experienced Indian fighter ; but I too had lived and fought for years among the Sioux in the North , and I knew that his chances were small against a party of cunning trailing Apaches .\nFinally I could endure the suspense no longer , and , arming myself with my two Colt revolvers and a carbine , I strapped two belts of cartridges about me and catching my saddle horse , started down the trail taken by Powell in the morning .\nAs soon as I reached comparatively level ground I urged my mount into a canter and continued this , where the going permitted , until , close upon dusk , I discovered the point where other tracks joined those of Powell .\nThey were the tracks of unshod ponies , three of them , and the ponies had been galloping .\nI followed rapidly until , darkness shutting down , I was forced to await the rising of the moon , and given an opportunity to speculate on the question of the wisdom of my chase .\nPossibly I had conjured up impossible dangers , like some nervous old housewife , and when I should catch up with Powell would get a good laugh for my pains .\nHowever , I am not prone to sensitiveness , and the following of a sense of duty , wherever it may lead , has always been a kind of fetich with me throughout my life ; which may account for the honors bestowed upon me by three republics and the decorations and friendships of an old and powerful emperor and several lesser kings , in whose service my sword has been red many a time .\nAbout nine o'clock the moon was sufficiently bright for me to proceed on my way and I had no difficulty in following the trail at a fast walk , and in some places at a brisk trot until , about midnight , I reached the water hole where Powell had expected to camp .\nI came upon the spot unexpectedly , finding it entirely deserted , with no signs of having been recently occupied as a camp .\nI was interested to note that the tracks of the pursuing horsemen , for such I was now convinced they must be , continued after Powell with only a brief stop at the hole for water ; and always at the same rate of speed as his .\nI was positive now that the trailers were Apaches and that they wished to capture Powell alive for the fiendish pleasure of the torture , so I urged my horse onward at a most dangerous pace , hoping against hope that I would catch up with the red rascals before they attacked him .\nFurther speculation was suddenly cut short by the faint report of two shots far ahead of me .\nI knew that Powell would need me now if ever , and I instantly urged my horse to his topmost speed up the narrow and difficult mountain trail .\nI had forged ahead for perhaps a mile or more without hearing further sounds , when the trail suddenly debouched onto a small , open plateau near the summit of the pass .\nI had passed through a narrow , overhanging gorge just before entering suddenly upon this table land , and the sight which met my eyes filled me with consternation and dismay .\nThe little stretch of level land was white with Indian tepees , and there were probably half a thousand red warriors clustered around some object near the center of the camp .\nTheir attention was so wholly riveted to this point of interest that they did not notice me , and I easily could have turned back into the dark recesses of the gorge and made my escape with perfect safety .\nThe fact , however , that this thought did not occur to me until the following day removes any possible right to a claim to heroism to which the narration of this episode might possibly otherwise entitle me .\nI do not believe that I am made of the stuff which constitutes heroes , because , in all of the hundreds of instances that my voluntary acts have placed me face to face with death , I can not recall a single one where any alternative step to that I took occurred to me until many hours later .\nMy mind is evidently so constituted that I am subconsciously forced into the path of duty without recourse to tiresome mental processes .\nHowever that may be , I have never regretted that cowardice is not optional with me .\nIn this instance I was , of course , positive that Powell was the center of attraction , but whether I thought or acted first I do not know , but within an instant from the moment the scene broke upon my view I had whipped out my revolvers and was charging down upon the entire army of warriors , shooting rapidly , and whooping at the top of my lungs .\nSinglehanded , I could not have pursued better tactics , for the red men , convinced by sudden surprise that not less than a regiment of regulars was upon them , turned and fled in every direction for their bows , arrows , and rifles .\nThe view which their hurried routing disclosed filled me with apprehension and with rage .\nUnder the clear rays of the Arizona moon lay Powell , his body fairly bristling with the hostile arrows of the braves .\nThat he was already dead I could not but be convinced , and yet I would have saved his body from mutilation at the hands of the Apaches as quickly as I would have saved the man himself from death .\nRiding close to him I reached down from the saddle , and grasping his cartridge belt drew him up across the withers of my mount .\nA backward glance convinced me that to return by the way I had come would be more hazardous than to continue across the plateau , so , putting spurs to my poor beast , I made a dash for the opening to the pass which I could distinguish on the far side of the table land .\n",

    "FOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF THE LATE DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER .\nA pleasing land of drowsy head it was , Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye ; And of gay castles in the clouds that pass , Forever flushing round a summer sky .\nCASTLE OF INDOLENCE .\nIn the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson , at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee , and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed , there lies a small market town or rural port , which by some is called Greensburgh , but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town .\nThis name was given , we are told , in former days , by the good housewives of the adjacent country , from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days .\nBe that as it may , I do not vouch for the fact , but merely advert to it , for the sake of being precise and authentic .\nNot far from this village , perhaps about two miles , there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills , which is one of the quietest places in the whole world .\nA small brook glides through it , with just murmur enough to lull one to repose ; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity .\nI recollect that , when a stripling , my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley .\nI had wandered into it at noontime , when all nature is peculiarly quiet , and was startled by the roar of my own gun , as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes .\nIf ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions , and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life , I know of none more promising than this little valley .\nFrom the listless repose of the place , and the peculiar character of its inhabitants , who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers , this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW , and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country .\nA drowsy , dreamy influence seems to hang over the land , and to pervade the very atmosphere .\nSome say that the place was bewitched by a High German doctor , during the early days of the settlement ; others , that an old Indian chief , the prophet or wizard of his tribe , held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson .\nCertain it is , the place still continues under the sway of some witching power , that holds a spell over the minds of the good people , causing them to walk in a continual reverie .\nThey are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs , are subject to trances and visions , and frequently see strange sights , and hear music and voices in the air .\nThe whole neighborhood abounds with local tales , haunted spots , and twilight superstitions ; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country , and the nightmare , with her whole ninefold , seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols .\nThe dominant spirit , however , that haunts this enchanted region , and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air , is the apparition of a figure on horseback , without a head .\nIt is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper , whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball , in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War , and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night , as if on the wings of the wind .\nHis haunts are not confined to the valley , but extend at times to the adjacent roads , and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance .\nIndeed , certain of the most authentic historians of those parts , who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre , allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard , the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head , and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow , like a midnight blast , is owing to his being belated , and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak .\nSuch is the general purport of this legendary superstition , which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows ; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides , by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow .\nIt is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley , but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time .\nHowever wide awake they may have been before they entered that sleepy region , they are sure , in a little time , to inhale the witching influence of the air , and begin to grow imaginative , to dream dreams , and see apparitions .\nI mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud , for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys , found here and there embosomed in the great State of New York , that population , manners , and customs remain fixed , while the great torrent of migration and improvement , which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country , sweeps by them unobserved .\nThey are like those little nooks of still water , which border a rapid stream , where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor , or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor , undisturbed by the rush of the passing current .\nThough many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow , yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom .\nIn this by-place of nature there abode , in a remote period of American history , that is to say , some thirty years since , a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane , who sojourned , or , as he expressed it , “ tarried , ” in Sleepy Hollow , for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity .\nHe was a native of Connecticut , a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest , and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters .\nThe cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person .\nHe was tall , but exceedingly lank , with narrow shoulders , long arms and legs , hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves , feet that might have served for shovels , and his whole frame most loosely hung together .\nHis head was small , and flat at top , with huge ears , large green glassy eyes , and a long snipe nose , so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew .\nTo see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day , with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him , one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth , or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield .\nHis schoolhouse was a low building of one large room , rudely constructed of logs ; the windows partly glazed , and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks .\nIt was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours , by a withe twisted in the handle of the door , and stakes set against the window shutters ; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease , he would find some embarrassment in getting out , -- an idea most probably borrowed by the architect , Yost Van Houten , from the mystery of an eelpot .\nThe schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation , just at the foot of a woody hill , with a brook running close by , and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it .\nFrom hence the low murmur of his pupils ’ voices , conning over their lessons , might be heard in a drowsy summer ’s day , like the hum of a beehive ; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master , in the tone of menace or command , or , peradventure , by the appalling sound of the birch , as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge .\nTruth to say , he was a conscientious man , and ever bore in mind the golden maxim , “ Spare the rod and spoil the child . ”\nIchabod Crane ’s scholars certainly were not spoiled .\nI would not have it imagined , however , that he was one of those cruel potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects ; on the contrary , he administered justice with discrimination rather than severity ; taking the burden off the backs of the weak , and laying it on those of the strong .\nYour mere puny stripling , that winced at the least flourish of the rod , was passed by with indulgence ; but the claims of justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little tough wrong-headed , broad-skirted Dutch urchin , who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch .\nAll this he called “ doing his duty by their parents ; ” and he never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance , so consolatory to the smarting urchin , that “ he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day he had to live . ”\nWhen school hours were over , he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys ; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home , who happened to have pretty sisters , or good housewives for mothers , noted for the comforts of the cupboard .\nIndeed , it behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils .\nThe revenue arising from his school was small , and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread , for he was a huge feeder , and , though lank , had the dilating powers of an anaconda ; but to help out his maintenance , he was , according to country custom in those parts , boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed .\nWith these he lived successively a week at a time , thus going the rounds of the neighborhood , with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief .\nThat all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic patrons , who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burden , and schoolmasters as mere drones , he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable .\nHe assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms , helped to make hay , mended the fences , took the horses to water , drove the cows from pasture , and cut wood for the winter fire .\nHe laid aside , too , all the dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little empire , the school , and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating .\nHe found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children , particularly the youngest ; and like the lion bold , which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold , he would sit with a child on one knee , and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together .\n",

    "THE SCARLET LETTER I .\nTHE PRISON DOOR A throng of bearded men , in sad-coloured garments and grey steeple-crowned hats , inter-mixed with women , some wearing hoods , and others bareheaded , was assembled in front of a wooden edifice , the door of which was heavily timbered with oak , and studded with iron spikes .\nThe founders of a new colony , whatever Utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project , have invariably recognised it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery , and another portion as the site of a prison .\nIn accordance with this rule it may safely be assumed that the forefathers of Boston had built the first prison-house somewhere in the Vicinity of Cornhill , almost as seasonably as they marked out the first burial-ground , on Isaac Johnson 's lot , and round about his grave , which subsequently became the nucleus of all the congregated sepulchres in the old churchyard of King 's Chapel .\nCertain it is that , some fifteen or twenty years after the settlement of the town , the wooden jail was already marked with weather-stains and other indications of age , which gave a yet darker aspect to its beetle-browed and gloomy front .\nThe rust on the ponderous iron-work of its oaken door looked more antique than anything else in the New World .\nLike all that pertains to crime , it seemed never to have known a youthful era .\nBefore this ugly edifice , and between it and the wheel-track of the street , was a grass-plot , much overgrown with burdock , pig-weed , apple-pern , and such unsightly vegetation , which evidently found something congenial in the soil that had so early borne the black flower of civilised society , a prison .\nBut on one side of the portal , and rooted almost at the threshold , was a wild rose-bush , covered , in this month of June , with its delicate gems , which might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to the prisoner as he went in , and to the condemned criminal as he came forth to his doom , in token that the deep heart of Nature could pity and be kind to him .\nThis rose-bush , by a strange chance , has been kept alive in history ; but whether it had merely survived out of the stern old wilderness , so long after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaks that originally overshadowed it , or whether , as there is fair authority for believing , it had sprung up under the footsteps of the sainted Ann Hutchinson as she entered the prison-door , we shall not take upon us to determine .\nFinding it so directly on the threshold of our narrative , which is now about to issue from that inauspicious portal , we could hardly do otherwise than pluck one of its flowers , and present it to the reader .\nIt may serve , let us hope , to symbolise some sweet moral blossom that may be found along the track , or relieve the darkening close of a tale of human frailty and sorrow .\nII .\nTHE MARKET-PLACE The grass-plot before the jail , in Prison Lane , on a certain summer morning , not less than two centuries ago , was occupied by a pretty large number of the inhabitants of Boston , all with their eyes intently fastened on the iron-clamped oaken door .\nAmongst any other population , or at a later period in the history of New England , the grim rigidity that petrified the bearded physiognomies of these good people would have augured some awful business in hand .\nIt could have betokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit , on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment .\nBut , in that early severity of the Puritan character , an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn .\nIt might be that a sluggish bond-servant , or an undutiful child , whom his parents had given over to the civil authority , was to be corrected at the whipping-post .\nIt might be that an Antinomian , a Quaker , or other heterodox religionist , was to be scourged out of the town , or an idle or vagrant Indian , whom the white man 's firewater had made riotous about the streets , was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest .\nIt might be , too , that a witch , like old Mistress Hibbins , the bitter-tempered widow of the magistrate , was to die upon the gallows .\nIn either case , there was very much the same solemnity of demeanour on the part of the spectators , as befitted a people among whom religion and law were almost identical , and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused , that the mildest and severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful .\nMeagre , indeed , and cold , was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for , from such bystanders , at the scaffold .\nOn the other hand , a penalty which , in our days , would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule , might then be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death itself .\nIt was a circumstance to be noted on the summer morning when our story begins its course , that the women , of whom there were several in the crowd , appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal infliction might be expected to ensue .\nThe age had not so much refinement , that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of petticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways , and wedging their not unsubstantial persons , if occasion were , into the throng nearest to the scaffold at an execution .\nMorally , as well as materially , there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old English birth and breeding than in their fair descendants , separated from them by a series of six or seven generations ; for , throughout that chain of ancestry , every successive mother had transmitted to her child a fainter bloom , a more delicate and briefer beauty , and a slighter physical frame , if not character of less force and solidity than her own .\nThe women who were now standing about the prison-door stood within less than half a century of the period when the man-like Elizabeth had been the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex .\nThey were her countrywomen : and the beef and ale of their native land , with a moral diet not a whit more refined , entered largely into their composition .\nThe bright morning sun , therefore , shone on broad shoulders and well-developed busts , and on round and ruddy cheeks , that had ripened in the far-off island , and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of New England .\nThere was , moreover , a boldness and rotundity of speech among these matrons , as most of them seemed to be , that would startle us at the present day , whether in respect to its purport or its volume of tone .\n\" Goodwives , \" said a hard-featured dame of fifty , \" I 'll tell ye a piece of my mind .\nIt would be greatly for the public behoof if we women , being of mature age and church-members in good repute , should have the handling of such malefactresses as this Hester Prynne .\nWhat think ye , gossips ?\nIf the hussy stood up for judgment before us five , that are now here in a knot together , would she come off with such a sentence as the worshipful magistrates have awarded ?\nMarry , I trow not . \"\n\" People say , \" said another , \" that the Reverend Master Dimmesdale , her godly pastor , takes it very grievously to heart that such a scandal should have come upon his congregation . \"\n\" The magistrates are God-fearing gentlemen , but merciful overmuch -- that is a truth , \" added a third autumnal matron .\n\" At the very least , they should have put the brand of a hot iron on Hester Prynne 's forehead .\nMadame Hester would have winced at that , I warrant me .\nBut she -- the naughty baggage -- little will she care what they put upon the bodice of her gown !\nWhy , look you , she may cover it with a brooch , or such like heathenish adornment , and so walk the streets as brave as ever ! \"\n\" Ah , but , \" interposed , more softly , a young wife , holding a child by the hand , \" let her cover the mark as she will , the pang of it will be always in her heart . \"\n\" What do we talk of marks and brands , whether on the bodice of her gown or the flesh of her forehead ? \"\ncried another female , the ugliest as well as the most pitiless of these self-constituted judges .\n\" This woman has brought shame upon us all , and ought to die ; is there not law for it ?\nTruly there is , both in the Scripture and the statute-book .\nThen let the magistrates , who have made it of no effect , thank themselves if their own wives and daughters go astray . \"\n\" Mercy on us , goodwife ! \"\nexclaimed a man in the crowd , \" is there no virtue in woman , save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows ?\nThat is the hardest word yet !\nHush now , gossips for the lock is turning in the prison-door , and here comes Mistress Prynne herself . \"\nThe door of the jail being flung open from within there appeared , in the first place , like a black shadow emerging into sunshine , the grim and grisly presence of the town-beadle , with a sword by his side , and his staff of office in his hand .\nThis personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the Puritanic code of law , which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender .\nStretching forth the official staff in his left hand , he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman , whom he thus drew forward , until , on the threshold of the prison-door , she repelled him , by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character , and stepped into the open air as if by her own free will .\nShe bore in her arms a child , a baby of some three months old , who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid light of day ; because its existence , heretofore , had brought it acquaintance only with the grey twilight of a dungeon , or other darksome apartment of the prison .\nWhen the young woman -- the mother of this child -- stood fully revealed before the crowd , it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom ; not so much by an impulse of motherly affection , as that she might thereby conceal a certain token , which was wrought or fastened into her dress .\nIn a moment , however , wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another , she took the baby on her arm , and with a burning blush , and yet a haughty smile , and a glance that would not be abashed , looked around at her townspeople and neighbours .\nOn the breast of her gown , in fine red cloth , surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of gold thread , appeared the letter A .\nIt was so artistically done , and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy , that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore , and which was of a splendour in accordance with the taste of the age , but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony .\n",

    "During the whole of a dull , dark , and soundless day in the autumn of the year , when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens , I had been passing alone , on horseback , through a singularly dreary tract of country ; and at length found myself , as the shades of the evening drew on , within view of the melancholy House of Usher .\nI know not how it was -- but , with the first glimpse of the building , a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit .\nI say insufferable ; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasureable , because poetic , sentiment , with which the mind usually receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible .\nI looked upon the scene before me -- upon the mere house , and the simple landscape features of the domain -- upon the bleak walls -- upon the vacant eye-like windows -- upon a few rank sedges -- and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees -- with an utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon opium -- the bitter lapse into everyday life -- the hideous dropping off of the veil .\nThere was an iciness , a sinking , a sickening of the heart -- an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime .\nWhat was it -- I paused to think -- what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the House of Usher ?\nIt was a mystery all insoluble ; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as I pondered .\nI was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion , that while , beyond doubt , there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us , still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth .\nIt was possible , I reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , I reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down -- but with a shudder even more thrilling than before -- upon the remodelled and inverted images of the grey sedge , and the ghastly tree-stems , and the vacant and eye-like windows .\nNevertheless , in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks .\nIts proprietor , Roderick Usher , had been one of my boon companions in boyhood ; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting .\nA letter , however , had lately reached me in a distant part of the country -- a letter from him -- which , in its wildly importunate nature , had admitted of no other than a personal reply .\nThe MS gave evidence of nervous agitation .\nThe writer spoke of acute bodily illness -- of a mental disorder which oppressed him -- and of an earnest desire to see me , as his best , and indeed his only personal friend , with a view of attempting , by the cheerfulness of my society , some alleviation of his malady .\nIt was the manner in which all this , and much more , was said -- it was the apparent heart that went with his request -- which allowed me no room for hesitation ; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still considered a very singular summons .\nAlthough , as boys , we had been even intimate associates , yet I really knew little of my friend .\nHis reserve had been always excessive and habitual .\nI was aware , however , that his very ancient family had been noted , time out of mind , for a peculiar sensibility of temperament , displaying itself , through long ages , in many works of exalted art , and manifested , of late , in repeated deeds of munificent yet unobtrusive charity , as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies , perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical science .\nI had learned , too , the very remarkable fact , that the stem of the Usher race , all time-honoured as it was , had put forth , at no period , any enduring branch ; in other words , that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent , and had always , with very trifling and very temporary variation , so lain .\nIt was this deficiency , I considered , while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the accredited character of the people , and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one , in the long lapse of centuries , might have exercised upon the other -- it was this deficiency , perhaps , of collateral issue , and the consequent undeviating transmission , from sire to son , of the patrimony with the name , which had , at length , so identified the two as to merge the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the \" House of Usher \" -- an appellation which seemed to include , in the minds of the peasantry who used it , both the family and the family mansion .\nI have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment -- that of looking down within the tarn -- had been to deepen the first singular impression .\nThere can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition -- for why should I not so term it ?\n-- served mainly to accelerate the increase itself .\nSuch , I have long known , is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis .\nAnd it might have been for this reason only , that , when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself , from its image in the pool , there grew in my mind a strange fancy -- a fancy so ridiculous , indeed , that I but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me .\nI had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity -- an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven , but which had reeked up from the decayed trees , and the grey wall , and the silent tarn -- a pestilent and mystic vapour , dull , sluggish , faintly discernible , and leaden-hued .\nShaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream , I scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building .\nIts principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity .\nThe discoloration of ages had been great .\nMinute fungi overspread the whole exterior , hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the eaves .\nYet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation .\nNo portion of the masonry had fallen ; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts , and the crumbling condition of the individual stones .\nIn this there was much that reminded me of the specious totality of old wood-work which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault , with no disturbance from the breath of the external air .\nBeyond this indication of extensive decay , however , the fabric gave little token of instability .\nPerhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure , which , extending from the roof of the building in front , made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction , until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn .\nNoticing these things , I rode over a short causeway to the house .\nA servant in waiting took my horse , and I entered the Gothic archway of the hall .\nA valet , of stealthy step , thence conducted me , in silence , through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master .\nMuch that I encountered on the way contributed , I know not how , to heighten the vague sentiments of which I have already spoken .\nWhile the objects around me -- while the carvings of the ceilings , the sombre tapestries of the walls , the ebon blackness of the floors , and the phantasmagoric armorial trophies which rattled as I strode , were but matters to which , or to such as which , I had been accustomed from my infancy -- while I hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this -- I still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up .\nOn one of the staircases , I met the physician of the family .\nHis countenance , I thought , wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity .\nHe accosted me with trepidation and passed on .\nThe valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master .\nThe room in which I found myself was very large and lofty .\nThe windows were long , narrow , and pointed , and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within .\nFeeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their way through the trellised panes , and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around ; the eye , however , struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber , or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling .\nDark draperies hung upon the walls .\nThe general furniture was profuse , comfortless , antique , and tattered .\nMany books and musical instruments lay scattered about , but failed to give any vitality to the scene .\nI felt that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow .\nAn air of stern , deep , and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all .\nUpon my entrance , Usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length , and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it , I at first thought , of an overdone cordiality -- of the constrained effort of the ennuye man of the world .\nA glance , however , at his countenance , convinced me of his perfect sincerity .\nWe sat down ; and for some moments , while he spoke not , I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity , half of awe .\nSurely , man had never before so terribly altered , in so brief a period , as had Roderick Usher !\nIt was with difficulty that I could bring myself to admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion of my early boyhood .\nYet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable .\nA cadaverousness of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a surpassingly beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate Hebrew model , but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar formations ; a finely-moulded chin , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than web-like softness and tenuity ; these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the temple , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten .\nAnd now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features , and of the expression they were wont to convey , lay so much of change that I doubted to whom I spoke .\nThe now ghastly pallor of the skin , and the now miraculous lustre of the eye , above all things startled and even awed me .\nThe silken hair , too , had been suffered to grow all unheeded , and as , in its wild gossamer texture , it floated rather than fell about the face , I could not , even with effort , connect its Arabesque expression with any idea of simple humanity .\n",

    "PART I I THIS is the saddest story I have ever heard .\nWe had known the Ashburnhams for nine seasons of the town of Nauheim with an extreme intimacy -- or , rather with an acquaintanceship as loose and easy and yet as close as a good glove 's with your hand .\nMy wife and I knew Captain and Mrs Ashburnham as well as it was possible to know anybody , and yet , in another sense , we knew nothing at all about them .\nThis is , I believe , a state of things only possible with English people of whom , till today , when I sit down to puzzle out what I know of this sad affair , I knew nothing whatever .\nSix months ago I had never been to England , and , certainly , I had never sounded the depths of an English heart .\nI had known the shallows .\nI do n't mean to say that we were not acquainted with many English people .\nLiving , as we perforce lived , in Europe , and being , as we perforce were , leisured Americans , which is as much as to say that we were un-American , we were thrown very much into the society of the nicer English .\nParis , you see , was our home .\nSomewhere between Nice and Bordighera provided yearly winter quarters for us , and Nauheim always received us from July to September .\nYou will gather from this statement that one of us had , as the saying is , a \" heart \" , and , from the statement that my wife is dead , that she was the sufferer .\nCaptain Ashburnham also had a heart .\nBut , whereas a yearly month or so at Nauheim tuned him up to exactly the right pitch for the rest of the twelvemonth , the two months or so were only just enough to keep poor Florence alive from year to year .\nThe reason for his heart was , approximately , polo , or too much hard sportsmanship in his youth .\nThe reason for poor Florence 's broken years was a storm at sea upon our first crossing to Europe , and the immediate reasons for our imprisonment in that continent were doctor 's orders .\nThey said that even the short Channel crossing might well kill the poor thing .\nWhen we all first met , Captain Ashburnham , home on sick leave from an India to which he was never to return , was thirty-three ; Mrs Ashburnham Leonora -- was thirty-one .\nI was thirty-six and poor Florence thirty .\nThus today Florence would have been thirty-nine and Captain Ashburnham forty-two ; whereas I am forty-five and Leonora forty .\nYou will perceive , therefore , that our friendship has been a young-middle-aged affair , since we were all of us of quite quiet dispositions , the Ashburnhams being more particularly what in England it is the custom to call \" quite good people \" .\nThey were descended , as you will probably expect , from the Ashburnham who accompanied Charles I to the scaffold , and , as you must also expect with this class of English people , you would never have noticed it .\nMrs Ashburnham was a Powys ; Florence was a Hurlbird of Stamford , Connecticut , where , as you know , they are more old-fashioned than even the inhabitants of Cranford , England , could have been .\nI myself am a Dowell of Philadelphia , Pa. , where , it is historically true , there are more old English families than you would find in any six English counties taken together .\nI carry about with me , indeed -- as if it were the only thing that invisibly anchored me to any spot upon the globe -- the title deeds of my farm , which once covered several blocks between Chestnut and Walnut Streets .\nThese title deeds are of wampum , the grant of an Indian chief to the first Dowell , who left Farnham in Surrey in company with William Penn .\nFlorence 's people , as is so often the case with the inhabitants of Connecticut , came from the neighbourhood of Fordingbridge , where the Ashburnhams ' place is .\nFrom there , at this moment , I am actually writing .\nYou may well ask why I write .\nAnd yet my reasons are quite many .\nFor it is not unusual in human beings who have witnessed the sack of a city or the falling to pieces of a people to desire to set down what they have witnessed for the benefit of unknown heirs or of generations infinitely remote ; or , if you please , just to get the sight out of their heads .\nSome one has said that the death of a mouse from cancer is the whole sack of Rome by the Goths , and I swear to you that the breaking up of our little four-square coterie was such another unthinkable event .\nSupposing that you should come upon us sitting together at one of the little tables in front of the club house , let us say , at Homburg , taking tea of an afternoon and watching the miniature golf , you would have said that , as human affairs go , we were an extraordinarily safe castle .\nWe were , if you will , one of those tall ships with the white sails upon a blue sea , one of those things that seem the proudest and the safest of all the beautiful and safe things that God has permitted the mind of men to frame .\nWhere better could one take refuge ?\nWhere better ?\nPermanence ?\nStability ?\nI ca n't believe it 's gone .\nI ca n't believe that that long , tranquil life , which was just stepping a minuet , vanished in four crashing days at the end of nine years and six weeks .\nUpon my word , yes , our intimacy was like a minuet , simply because on every possible occasion and in every possible circumstance we knew where to go , where to sit , which table we unanimously should choose ; and we could rise and go , all four together , without a signal from any one of us , always to the music of the Kur orchestra , always in the temperate sunshine , or , if it rained , in discreet shelters .\nNo , indeed , it ca n't be gone .\nYou ca n't kill a minuet de la cour .\nYou may shut up the music-book , close the harpsichord ; in the cupboard and presses the rats may destroy the white satin favours .\nThe mob may sack Versailles ; the Trianon may fall , but surely the minuet -- the minuet itself is dancing itself away into the furthest stars , even as our minuet of the Hessian bathing places must be stepping itself still .\nIs n't there any heaven where old beautiful dances , old beautiful intimacies prolong themselves ?\nIs n't there any Nirvana pervaded by the faint thrilling of instruments that have fallen into the dust of wormwood but that yet had frail , tremulous , and everlasting souls ?\nNo , by God , it is false !\nIt was n't a minuet that we stepped ; it was a prison -- a prison full of screaming hysterics , tied down so that they might not outsound the rolling of our carriage wheels as we went along the shaded avenues of the Taunus Wald .\nAnd yet I swear by the sacred name of my creator that it was true .\nIt was true sunshine ; the true music ; the true splash of the fountains from the mouth of stone dolphins .\nFor , if for me we were four people with the same tastes , with the same desires , acting -- or , no , not acting -- sitting here and there unanimously , is n't that the truth ?\nIf for nine years I have possessed a goodly apple that is rotten at the core and discover its rottenness only in nine years and six months less four days , is n't it true to say that for nine years I possessed a goodly apple ?\nSo it may well be with Edward Ashburnham , with Leonora his wife and with poor dear Florence .\nAnd , if you come to think of it , is n't it a little odd that the physical rottenness of at least two pillars of our four-square house never presented itself to my mind as a menace to its security ?\nIt does n't so present itself now though the two of them are actually dead .\nI do n't know ... .\nI know nothing -- nothing in the world -- of the hearts of men .\nI only know that I am alone -- horribly alone .\nNo hearthstone will ever again witness , for me , friendly intercourse .\nNo smoking-room will ever be other than peopled with incalculable simulacra amidst smoke wreaths .\nYet , in the name of God , what should I know if I do n't know the life of the hearth and of the smoking-room , since my whole life has been passed in those places ?\nThe warm hearthside !\n-- Well , there was Florence : I believe that for the twelve years her life lasted , after the storm that seemed irretrievably to have weakened her heart -- I do n't believe that for one minute she was out of my sight , except when she was safely tucked up in bed and I should be downstairs , talking to some good fellow or other in some lounge or smoking-room or taking my final turn with a cigar before going to bed .\nI do n't , you understand , blame Florence .\nBut how can she have known what she knew ?\nHow could she have got to know it ?\nTo know it so fully .\nHeavens !\nThere does n't seem to have been the actual time .\nIt must have been when I was taking my baths , and my Swedish exercises , being manicured .\nLeading the life I did , of the sedulous , strained nurse , I had to do something to keep myself fit .\nIt must have been then !\nYet even that ca n't have been enough time to get the tremendously long conversations full of worldly wisdom that Leonora has reported to me since their deaths .\nAnd is it possible to imagine that during our prescribed walks in Nauheim and the neighbourhood she found time to carry on the protracted negotiations which she did carry on between Edward Ashburnham and his wife ?\nAnd is n't it incredible that during all that time Edward and Leonora never spoke a word to each other in private ?\nWhat is one to think of humanity ?\nFor I swear to you that they were the model couple .\nHe was as devoted as it was possible to be without appearing fatuous .\nSo well set up , with such honest blue eyes , such a touch of stupidity , such a warm goodheartedness !\nAnd she -- so tall , so splendid in the saddle , so fair !\nYes , Leonora was extraordinarily fair and so extraordinarily the real thing that she seemed too good to be true .\nYou do n't , I mean , as a rule , get it all so superlatively together .\nTo be the county family , to look the county family , to be so appropriately and perfectly wealthy ; to be so perfect in manner -- even just to the saving touch of insolence that seems to be necessary .\nTo have all that and to be all that !\nNo , it was too good to be true .\nAnd yet , only this afternoon , talking over the whole matter she said to me : \" Once I tried to have a lover but I was so sick at the heart , so utterly worn out that I had to send him away . \"\nThat struck me as the most amazing thing I had ever heard .\nShe said \" I was actually in a man 's arms .\nSuch a nice chap !\nSuch a dear fellow !\nAnd I was saying to myself , fiercely , hissing it between my teeth , as they say in novels -- and really clenching them together : I was saying to myself : ' Now , I 'm in for it and I 'll really have a good time for once in my life -- for once in my life ! '\nIt was in the dark , in a carriage , coming back from a hunt ball .\nEleven miles we had to drive !\nAnd then suddenly the bitterness of the endless poverty , of the endless acting -- it fell on me like a blight , it spoilt everything .\nYes , I had to realize that I had been spoilt even for the good time when it came .\nAnd I burst out crying and I cried and I cried for the whole eleven miles .\nJust imagine me crying !\nAnd just imagine me making a fool of the poor dear chap like that .\nIt certainly was n't playing the game , was it now ? \"\n",

    "I .\nThe Return THERE WAS SOMETHING about the coast town of Dunnet which made it seem more attractive than other maritime villages of eastern Maine .\nPerhaps it was the simple fact of acquaintance with that neighborhood which made it so attaching , and gave such interest to the rocky shore and dark woods , and the few houses which seemed to be securely wedged and tree-nailed in among the ledges by the Landing .\nThese houses made the most of their seaward view , and there was a gayety and determined floweriness in their bits of garden ground ; the small-paned high windows in the peaks of their steep gables were like knowing eyes that watched the harbor and the far sea-line beyond , or looked northward all along the shore and its background of spruces and balsam firs .\nWhen one really knows a village like this and its surroundings , it is like becoming acquainted with a single person .\nThe process of falling in love at first sight is as final as it is swift in such a case , but the growth of true friendship may be a lifelong affair .\nAfter a first brief visit made two or three summers before in the course of a yachting cruise , a lover of Dunnet Landing returned to find the unchanged shores of the pointed firs , the same quaintness of the village with its elaborate conventionalities ; all that mixture of remoteness , and childish certainty of being the centre of civilization of which her affectionate dreams had told .\nOne evening in June , a single passenger landed upon the steamboat wharf .\nThe tide was high , there was a fine crowd of spectators , and the younger portion of the company followed her with subdued excitement up the narrow street of the salt-aired , white-clapboarded little town .\nII .\nMrs. Todd LATER , THERE WAS only one fault to find with this choice of a summer lodging-place , and that was its complete lack of seclusion .\nAt first the tiny house of Mrs. Almira Todd , which stood with its end to the street , appeared to be retired and sheltered enough from the busy world , behind its bushy bit of a green garden , in which all the blooming things , two or three gay hollyhocks and some London-pride , were pushed back against the gray-shingled wall .\nIt was a queer little garden and puzzling to a stranger , the few flowers being put at a disadvantage by so much greenery ; but the discovery was soon made that Mrs. Todd was an ardent lover of herbs , both wild and tame , and the sea-breezes blew into the low end-window of the house laden with not only sweet-brier and sweet-mary , but balm and sage and borage and mint , wormwood and southernwood .\nIf Mrs. Todd had occasion to step into the far corner of her herb plot , she trod heavily upon thyme , and made its fragrant presence known with all the rest .\nBeing a very large person , her full skirts brushed and bent almost every slender stalk that her feet missed .\nYou could always tell when she was stepping about there , even when you were half awake in the morning , and learned to know , in the course of a few weeks ’ experience , in exactly which corner of the garden she might be .\nAt one side of this herb plot were other growths of a rustic pharmacopoeia , great treasures and rarities among the commoner herbs .\nThere were some strange and pungent odors that roused a dim sense and remembrance of something in the forgotten past .\nSome of these might once have belonged to sacred and mystic rites , and have had some occult knowledge handed with them down the centuries ; but now they pertained only to humble compounds brewed at intervals with molasses or vinegar or spirits in a small caldron on Mrs. Todd ’s kitchen stove .\nThey were dispensed to suffering neighbors , who usually came at night as if by stealth , bringing their own ancient-looking vials to be filled .\nOne nostrum was called the Indian remedy , and its price was but fifteen cents ; the whispered directions could be heard as customers passed the windows .\nWith most remedies the purchaser was allowed to depart unadmonished from the kitchen , Mrs. Todd being a wise saver of steps ; but with certain vials she gave cautions , standing in the doorway , and there were other doses which had to be accompanied on their healing way as far as the gate , while she muttered long chapters of directions , and kept up an air of secrecy and importance to the last .\nIt may not have been only the common aids of humanity with which she tried to cope ; it seemed sometimes as if love and hate and jealousy and adverse winds at sea might also find their proper remedies among the curious wild-looking plants in Mrs. Todd ’s garden .\nThe village doctor and this learned herbalist were upon the best of terms .\nThe good man may have counted upon the unfavorable effect of certain potions which he should find his opportunity in counteracting ; at any rate , he now and then stopped and exchanged greetings with Mrs. Todd over the picket fence .\nThe conversation became at once professional after the briefest preliminaries , and he would stand twirling a sweet-scented sprig in his fingers , and make suggestive jokes , perhaps about her faith in a too persistent course of thoroughwort elixir , in which my landlady professed such firm belief as sometimes to endanger the life and usefulness of worthy neighbors .\nTo arrive at this quietest of seaside villages late in June , when the busy herb-gathering season was just beginning , was also to arrive in the early prime of Mrs. Todd ’s activity in the brewing of old-fashioned spruce beer .\nThis cooling and refreshing drink had been brought to wonderful perfection through a long series of experiments ; it had won immense local fame , and the supplies for its manufacture were always giving out and having to be replenished .\nFor various reasons , the seclusion and uninterrupted days which had been looked forward to proved to be very rare in this otherwise delightful corner of the world .\nMy hostess and I had made our shrewd business agreement on the basis of a simple cold luncheon at noon , and liberal restitution in the matter of hot suppers , to provide for which the lodger might sometimes be seen hurrying down the road , late in the day , with cunner line in hand .\nIt was soon found that this arrangement made large allowance for Mrs. Todd ’s slow herb-gathering progresses through woods and pastures .\nThe spruce-beer customers were pretty steady in hot weather , and there were many demands for different soothing syrups and elixirs with which the unwise curiosity of my early residence had made me acquainted .\nKnowing Mrs. Todd to be a widow , who had little beside this slender business and the income from one hungry lodger to maintain her , one ’s energies and even interest were quickly bestowed , until it became a matter of course that she should go afield every pleasant day , and that the lodger should answer all peremptory knocks at the side door .\nIn taking an occasional wisdom-giving stroll in Mrs. Todd ’s company , and in acting as business partner during her frequent absences , I found the July days fly fast , and it was not until I felt myself confronted with too great pride and pleasure in the display , one night , of two dollars and twenty-seven cents which I had taken in during the day , that I remembered a long piece of writing , sadly belated now , which I was bound to do .\nTo have been patted kindly on the shoulder and called “ darlin ’ , ” to have been offered a surprise of early mushrooms for supper , to have had all the glory of making two dollars and twenty-seven cents in a single day , and then to renounce it all and withdraw from these pleasant successes , needed much resolution .\nLiterary employments are so vexed with uncertainties at best , and it was not until the voice of conscience sounded louder in my ears than the sea on the nearest pebble beach that I said unkind words of withdrawal to Mrs. Todd .\nShe only became more wistfully affectionate than ever in her expressions , and looked as disappointed as I expected when I frankly told her that I could no longer enjoy the pleasure of what we called “ seein ’ folks . ”\nI felt that I was cruel to a whole neighborhood in curtailing her liberty in this most important season for harvesting the different wild herbs that were so much counted upon to ease their winter ails .\n“ Well , dear , ” she said sorrowfully , “ I ’ve took great advantage o ’ your bein ’ here .\nI ai n’t had such a season for years , but I have never had nobody I could so trust .\nAll you lack is a few qualities , but with time you ’d gain judgment an ’ experience , an ’ be very able in the business .\nI ’d stand right here an ’ say it to anybody . ”\nMrs. Todd and I were not separated or estranged by the change in our business relations ; on the contrary , a deeper intimacy seemed to begin .\nI do not know what herb of the night it was that used sometimes to send out a penetrating odor late in the evening , after the dew had fallen , and the moon was high , and the cool air came up from the sea .\nThen Mrs. Todd would feel that she must talk to somebody , and I was only too glad to listen .\nWe both fell under the spell , and she either stood outside the window , or made an errand to my sitting-room , and told , it might be very commonplace news of the day , or , as happened one misty summer night , all that lay deepest in her heart .\nIt was in this way that I came to know that she had loved one who was far above her .\n“ No , dear , him I speak of could never think of me , ” she said .\n“ When we was young together his mother did n’t favor the match , an ’ done everything she could to part us ; and folks thought we both married well , but ’ t wa ’n’ t what either one of us wanted most ; an ’ now we ’re left alone again , an ’ might have had each other all the time .\nHe was above bein ’ a seafarin ’ man , an ’ prospered more than most ; he come of a high family , an ’ my lot was plain an ’ hard-workin ’ .\nI ai n’t seen him for some years ; he ’s forgot our youthful feelin ’s , I expect , but a woman ’s heart is different ; them feelin ’s comes back when you think you ’ve done with ‘ em , as sure as spring comes with the year .\nAn ’ I ’ve always had ways of hearin ’ about him . ”\nShe stood in the centre of a braided rug , and its rings of black and gray seemed to circle about her feet in the dim light .\nHer height and massiveness in the low room gave her the look of a huge sibyl , while the strange fragrance of the mysterious herb blew in from the little garden .\n",

    "CHAPTER I THE CONSUL ’S YARN A week had passed since the funeral of my poor boy Harry , and one evening I was in my room walking up and down and thinking , when there was a ring at the outer door .\nGoing down the steps I opened it myself , and in came my old friends Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good , RN .\nThey entered the vestibule and sat themselves down before the wide hearth , where , I remember , a particularly good fire of logs was burning .\n‘ It is very kind of you to come round , ’ I said by way of making a remark ; ‘ it must have been heavy walking in the snow . ’\nThey said nothing , but Sir Henry slowly filled his pipe and lit it with a burning ember .\nAs he leant forward to do so the fire got hold of a gassy bit of pine and flared up brightly , throwing the whole scene into strong relief , and I thought , What a splendid-looking man he is !\nCalm , powerful face , clear-cut features , large grey eyes , yellow beard and hair -- altogether a magnificent specimen of the higher type of humanity .\nNor did his form belie his face .\nI have never seen wider shoulders or a deeper chest .\nIndeed , Sir Henry ’s girth is so great that , though he is six feet two high , he does not strike one as a tall man .\nAs I looked at him I could not help thinking what a curious contrast my little dried-up self presented to his grand face and form .\nImagine to yourself a small , withered , yellow-faced man of sixty-three , with thin hands , large brown eyes , a head of grizzled hair cut short and standing up like a half-worn scrubbing-brush -- total weight in my clothes , nine stone six -- and you will get a very fair idea of Allan Quatermain , commonly called Hunter Quatermain , or by the natives ‘ Macumazahn ’ -- Anglicè , he who keeps a bright look-out at night , or , in vulgar English , a sharp fellow who is not to be taken in .\nThen there was Good , who is not like either of us , being short , dark , stout -- _ very _ stout -- with twinkling black eyes , in one of which an eyeglass is everlastingly fixed .\nI say stout , but it is a mild term ; I regret to state that of late years Good has been running to fat in a most disgraceful way .\nSir Henry tells him that it comes from idleness and over-feeding , and Good does not like it at all , though he can not deny it .\nWe sat for a while , and then I got a match and lit the lamp that stood ready on the table , for the half-light began to grow dreary , as it is apt to do when one has a short week ago buried the hope of one ’s life .\nNext , I opened a cupboard in the wainscoting and got a bottle of whisky and some tumblers and water .\nI always like to do these things for myself : it is irritating to me to have somebody continually at my elbow , as though I were an eighteen-month-old baby .\nAll this while Curtis and Good had been silent , feeling , I suppose , that they had nothing to say that could do me any good , and content to give me the comfort of their presence and unspoken sympathy ; for it was only their second visit since the funeral .\nAnd it is , by the way , from the _ presence _ of others that we really derive support in our dark hours of grief , and not from their talk , which often only serves to irritate us .\nBefore a bad storm the game always herd together , but they cease their calling .\nThey sat and smoked and drank whisky and water , and I stood by the fire also smoking and looking at them .\nAt last I spoke .\n‘ Old friends , ’ I said , ‘ how long is it since we got back from Kukuanaland ? ’\n‘ Three years , ’ said Good .\n‘ Why do you ask ? ’\n‘ I ask because I think that I have had a long enough spell of civilization .\nI am going back to the veldt . ’\nSir Henry laid his head back in his arm-chair and laughed one of his deep laughs .\n‘ How very odd , ’ he said , ‘ eh , Good ? ’\nGood beamed at me mysteriously through his eyeglass and murmured , ‘ Yes , odd -- very odd . ’\n‘ I do n’t quite understand , ’ said I , looking from one to the other , for I dislike mysteries .\n‘ Do n’t you , old fellow ? ’\nsaid Sir Henry ; ‘ then I will explain .\nAs Good and I were walking up here we had a talk . ’\n‘ If Good was there you probably did , ’ I put in sarcastically , for Good is a great hand at talking .\n‘ And what may it have been about ? ’\n‘ What do you think ? ’\nasked Sir Henry .\nI shook my head .\nIt was not likely that I should know what Good might be talking about .\nHe talks about so many things .\n‘ Well , it was about a little plan that I have formed -- namely , that if you were willing we should pack up our traps and go off to Africa on another expedition . ’\nI fairly jumped at his words .\n‘ You do n’t say so ! ’\nI said .\n‘ Yes I do , though , and so does Good ; do n’t you , Good ? ’\n‘ Rather , ’ said that gentleman .\n‘ Listen , old fellow , ’ went on Sir Henry , with considerable animation of manner .\n‘ I ’m tired of it too , dead-tired of doing nothing more except play the squire in a country that is sick of squires .\nFor a year or more I have been getting as restless as an old elephant who scents danger .\nI am always dreaming of Kukuanaland and Gagool and King Solomon ’s Mines .\nI can assure you I have become the victim of an almost unaccountable craving .\nI am sick of shooting pheasants and partridges , and want to have a go at some large game again .\nThere , you know the feeling -- when one has once tasted brandy and water , milk becomes insipid to the palate .\nThat year we spent together up in Kukuanaland seems to me worth all the other years of my life put together .\nI dare say that I am a fool for my pains , but I ca n’t help it ; I long to go , and , what is more , I mean to go . ’\nHe paused , and then went on again .\n‘ And , after all , why should I not go ?\nI have no wife or parent , no chick or child to keep me .\nIf anything happens to me the baronetcy will go to my brother George and his boy , as it would ultimately do in any case .\nI am of no importance to any one . ’\n‘ Ah ! ’\nI said , ‘ I thought you would come to that sooner or later .\nAnd now , Good , what is your reason for wanting to trek ; have you got one ? ’\n‘ I have , ’ said Good , solemnly .\n‘ I never do anything without a reason ; and it is n’t a lady -- at least , if it is , it ’s several . ’\nI looked at him again .\nGood is so overpoweringly frivolous .\n‘ What is it ? ’\nI said .\n‘ Well , if you really want to know , though I ’d rather not speak of a delicate and strictly personal matter , I ’ll tell you : I ’m getting too fat . ’\n‘ Shut up , Good ! ’\nsaid Sir Henry .\n‘ And now , Quatermain , tell us , where do you propose going to ? ’\nI lit my pipe , which had gone out , before answering .\n‘ Have you people ever heard of Mt Kenia ? ’\nI asked .\n‘ Do n’t know the place , ’ said Good .\n‘ Did you ever hear of the Island of Lamu ? ’\nI asked again .\n‘ No .\nStop , though -- is n’t it a place about 300 miles north of Zanzibar ? ’\n‘ Yes .\nNow listen .\nWhat I have to propose is this .\nThat we go to Lamu and thence make our way about 250 miles inland to Mt Kenia ; from Mt Kenia on inland to Mt Lekakisera , another 200 miles , or thereabouts , beyond which no white man has to the best of my belief ever been ; and then , if we get so far , right on into the unknown interior .\nWhat do you say to that , my hearties ? ’\n‘ It ’s a big order , ’ said Sir Henry , reflectively .\n‘ You are right , ’ I answered , ‘ it is ; but I take it that we are all three of us in search of a big order .\nWe want a change of scene , and we are likely to get one -- a thorough change .\nAll my life I have longed to visit those parts , and I mean to do it before I die .\nMy poor boy ’s death has broken the last link between me and civilization , and I ’m off to my native wilds .\nAnd now I ’ll tell you another thing , and that is , that for years and years I have heard rumours of a great white race which is supposed to have its home somewhere up in this direction , and I have a mind to see if there is any truth in them .\nIf you fellows like to come , well and good ; if not , I ’ll go alone . ’\n‘ I ’m your man , though I do n’t believe in your white race , ’ said Sir Henry Curtis , rising and placing his arm upon my shoulder .\n‘ Ditto , ’ remarked Good .\n‘ I ’ll go into training at once .\nBy all means let ’s go to Mt Kenia and the other place with an unpronounceable name , and look for a white race that does not exist .\nIt ’s all one to me . ’\n‘ When do you propose to start ? ’\nasked Sir Henry .\n‘ This day month , ’ I answered , ‘ by the British India steamboat ; and do n’t you be so certain that things have no existence because you do not happen to have heard of them .\nRemember King Solomon ’s mines ! ’\nSome fourteen weeks or so had passed since the date of this conversation , and this history goes on its way in very different surroundings .\n",

    "CHAPTER I TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH Among other public buildings in a certain town , which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning , and to which I will assign no fictitious name , there is one anciently common to most towns , great or small : to wit , a workhouse ; and in this workhouse was born ; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat , inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader , in this stage of the business at all events ; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter .\nFor a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble , by the parish surgeon , it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all ; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared ; or , if they had , that being comprised within a couple of pages , they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography , extant in the literature of any age or country .\nAlthough I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse , is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being , I do mean to say that in this particular instance , it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred .\nThe fact is , that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration , -- a troublesome practice , but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence ; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress , rather unequally poised between this world and the next : the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter .\nNow , if , during this brief period , Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers , anxious aunts , experienced nurses , and doctors of profound wisdom , he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time .\nThere being nobody by , however , but a pauper old woman , who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer ; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract ; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them .\nThe result was , that , after a few struggles , Oliver breathed , sneezed , and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish , by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage , a voice , for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter .\nAs Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs , the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead , rustled ; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow ; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words , ' Let me see the child , and die . '\nThe surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire : giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately .\nAs the young woman spoke , he rose , and advancing to the bed 's head , said , with more kindness than might have been expected of him : ' Oh , you must not talk about dying yet . '\n' Lor bless her dear heart , no ! '\ninterposed the nurse , hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle , the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction .\n' Lor bless her dear heart , when she has lived as long as I have , sir , and had thirteen children of her own , and all on 'em dead except two , and them in the wurkus with me , she 'll know better than to take on in that way , bless her dear heart !\nThink what it is to be a mother , there 's a dear young lamb do . '\nApparently this consolatory perspective of a mother 's prospects failed in producing its due effect .\nThe patient shook her head , and stretched out her hand towards the child .\nThe surgeon deposited it in her arms .\nShe imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead ; passed her hands over her face ; gazed wildly round ; shuddered ; fell back -- and died .\nThey chafed her breast , hands , and temples ; but the blood had stopped forever .\nThey talked of hope and comfort .\nThey had been strangers too long .\n' It 's all over , Mrs. Thingummy ! '\nsaid the surgeon at last .\n' Ah , poor dear , so it is ! '\nsaid the nurse , picking up the cork of the green bottle , which had fallen out on the pillow , as she stooped to take up the child .\n' Poor dear ! '\n' You need n't mind sending up to me , if the child cries , nurse , ' said the surgeon , putting on his gloves with great deliberation .\n' It 's very likely it _ will _ be troublesome .\nGive it a little gruel if it is . '\nHe put on his hat , and , pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door , added , ' She was a good-looking girl , too ; where did she come from ? '\n' She was brought here last night , ' replied the old woman , ' by the overseer 's order .\nShe was found lying in the street .\nShe had walked some distance , for her shoes were worn to pieces ; but where she came from , or where she was going to , nobody knows . '\nThe surgeon leaned over the body , and raised the left hand .\n' The old story , ' he said , shaking his head : ' no wedding-ring , I see .\nAh !\nGood-night ! '\nThe medical gentleman walked away to dinner ; and the nurse , having once more applied herself to the green bottle , sat down on a low chair before the fire , and proceeded to dress the infant .\nWhat an excellent example of the power of dress , young Oliver Twist was !\nWrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering , he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar ; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society .\nBut now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service , he was badged and ticketed , and fell into his place at once -- a parish child -- the orphan of a workhouse -- the humble , half-starved drudge -- to be cuffed and buffeted through the world -- despised by all , and pitied by none .\nOliver cried lustily .\nIf he could have known that he was an orphan , left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers , perhaps he would have cried the louder .\nCHAPTER II TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST 'S GROWTH , EDUCATION , AND BOARD For the next eight or ten months , Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception .\nHe was brought up by hand .\nThe hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities .\nThe parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities , whether there was no female then domiciled in ' the house ' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist , the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need .\nThe workhouse authorities replied with humility , that there was not .\nUpon this , the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved , that Oliver should be ' farmed , ' or , in other words , that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off , where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws , rolled about the floor all day , without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing , under the parental superintendence of an elderly female , who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week .\nSevenpence-halfpenny 's worth per week is a good round diet for a child ; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny , quite enough to overload its stomach , and make it uncomfortable .\nThe elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience ; she knew what was good for children ; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself .\nSo , she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use , and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them .\nThereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still ; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher .\nEverybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating , and who demonstrated it so well , that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day , and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all , if he had not died , four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air .\nUnfortunately for , the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over , a similar result usually attended the operation of _ her _ system ; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food , it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten , either that it sickened from want and cold , or fell into the fire from neglect , or got half-smothered by accident ; in any one of which cases , the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world , and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this .\nOccasionally , when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead , or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing -- though the latter accident was very scarce , anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm -- the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions , or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance .\nBut these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon , and the testimony of the beadle ; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside ( which was very probable indeed ) , and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted ; which was very self-devotional .\nBesides , the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm , and always sent the beadle the day before , to say they were going .\nThe children were neat and clean to behold , when _ they _ went ; and what more would the people have !\n",

    "CHAPTER I .\nYOU do n't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ; but that ai n't no matter .\nThat book was made by Mr. Mark Twain , and he told the truth , mainly .\nThere was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth .\nThat is nothing .\nI never seen anybody but lied one time or another , without it was Aunt Polly , or the widow , or maybe Mary .\nAunt Polly -- Tom 's Aunt Polly , she is -- and Mary , and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book , which is mostly a true book , with some stretchers , as I said before .\nNow the way that the book winds up is this : Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave , and it made us rich .\nWe got six thousand dollars apiece -- all gold .\nIt was an awful sight of money when it was piled up .\nWell , Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest , and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round -- more than a body could tell what to do with .\nThe Widow Douglas she took me for her son , and allowed she would sivilize me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways ; and so when I could n't stand it no longer I lit out .\nI got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again , and was free and satisfied .\nBut Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers , and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable .\nSo I went back .\nThe widow she cried over me , and called me a poor lost lamb , and she called me a lot of other names , too , but she never meant no harm by it .\nShe put me in them new clothes again , and I could n't do nothing but sweat and sweat , and feel all cramped up .\nWell , then , the old thing commenced again .\nThe widow rung a bell for supper , and you had to come to time .\nWhen you got to the table you could n't go right to eating , but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals , though there war n't really anything the matter with them , -- that is , nothing only everything was cooked by itself .\nIn a barrel of odds and ends it is different ; things get mixed up , and the juice kind of swaps around , and the things go better .\nAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers , and I was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time ; so then I did n't care no more about him , because I do n't take no stock in dead people .\nPretty soon I wanted to smoke , and asked the widow to let me .\nBut she would n't .\nShe said it was a mean practice and was n't clean , and I must try to not do it any more .\nThat is just the way with some people .\nThey get down on a thing when they do n't know nothing about it .\nHere she was a-bothering about Moses , which was no kin to her , and no use to anybody , being gone , you see , yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it .\nAnd she took snuff , too ; of course that was all right , because she done it herself .\nHer sister , Miss Watson , a tolerable slim old maid , with goggles on , had just come to live with her , and took a set at me now with a spelling-book .\nShe worked me middling hard for about an hour , and then the widow made her ease up .\nI could n't stood it much longer .\nThen for an hour it was deadly dull , and I was fidgety .\nMiss Watson would say , “ Do n't put your feet up there , Huckleberry ; ” and “ Do n't scrunch up like that , Huckleberry -- set up straight ; ” and pretty soon she would say , “ Do n't gap and stretch like that , Huckleberry -- why do n't you try to behave ? ”\nThen she told me all about the bad place , and I said I wished I was there .\nShe got mad then , but I did n't mean no harm .\nAll I wanted was to go somewheres ; all I wanted was a change , I war n't particular .\nShe said it was wicked to say what I said ; said she would n't say it for the whole world ; she was going to live so as to go to the good place .\nWell , I could n't see no advantage in going where she was going , so I made up my mind I would n't try for it .\nBut I never said so , because it would only make trouble , and would n't do no good .\nNow she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place .\nShe said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever .\nSo I did n't think much of it .\nBut I never said so .\nI asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there , and she said not by a considerable sight .\nI was glad about that , because I wanted him and me to be together .\nMiss Watson she kept pecking at me , and it got tiresome and lonesome .\nBy and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers , and then everybody was off to bed .\nI went up to my room with a piece of candle , and put it on the table .\nThen I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful , but it war n't no use .\nI felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead .\nThe stars were shining , and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful ; and I heard an owl , away off , who-whooing about somebody that was dead , and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die ; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me , and I could n't make out what it was , and so it made the cold shivers run over me .\nThen away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that 's on its mind and ca n't make itself understood , and so ca n't rest easy in its grave , and has to go about that way every night grieving .\nI got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company .\nPretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder , and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle ; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up .\nI did n't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck , so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me .\nI got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time ; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away .\nBut I had n't no confidence .\nYou do that when you 've lost a horseshoe that you 've found , instead of nailing it up over the door , but I had n't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you 'd killed a spider .\nI set down again , a-shaking all over , and got out my pipe for a smoke ; for the house was all as still as death now , and so the widow would n't know .\nWell , after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom -- boom -- boom -- twelve licks ; and all still again -- stiller than ever .\nPretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees -- something was a stirring .\nI set still and listened .\nDirectly I could just barely hear a “ me-yow !\nme-yow ! ”\ndown there .\nThat was good !\nSays I , “ me-yow !\nme-yow ! ”\nas soft as I could , and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed .\nThen I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees , and , sure enough , there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me .\nCHAPTER II .\nWE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow 's garden , stooping down so as the branches would n't scrape our heads .\nWhen we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise .\nWe scrouched down and laid still .\nMiss Watson 's big nigger , named Jim , was setting in the kitchen door ; we could see him pretty clear , because there was a light behind him .\nHe got up and stretched his neck out about a minute , listening .\nThen he says : “ Who dah ? ”\nHe listened some more ; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us ; we could a touched him , nearly .\nWell , likely it was minutes and minutes that there war n't a sound , and we all there so close together .\nThere was a place on my ankle that got to itching , but I das n't scratch it ; and then my ear begun to itch ; and next my back , right between my shoulders .\nSeemed like I 'd die if I could n't scratch .\nWell , I 've noticed that thing plenty times since .\nIf you are with the quality , or at a funeral , or trying to go to sleep when you ai n't sleepy -- if you are anywheres where it wo n't do for you to scratch , why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places .\nPretty soon Jim says : “ Say , who is you ?\nWhar is you ?\nDog my cats ef I didn ' hear sumf ' n. Well , I know what I 's gwyne to do : I 's gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin . ”\nSo he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom .\nHe leaned his back up against a tree , and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine .\nMy nose begun to itch .\nIt itched till the tears come into my eyes .\nBut I das n't scratch .\nThen it begun to itch on the inside .\nNext I got to itching underneath .\nI did n't know how I was going to set still .\nThis miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes ; but it seemed a sight longer than that .\nI was itching in eleven different places now .\nI reckoned I could n't stand it more 'n a minute longer , but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try .\nJust then Jim begun to breathe heavy ; next he begun to snore -- and then I was pretty soon comfortable again .\n",

    "PART ONE -- The Old Buccaneer 1 The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow SQUIRE TRELAWNEY , Dr. Livesey , and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island , from the beginning to the end , keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island , and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted , I take up my pen in the year of grace 17 __ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof .\nI remember him as if it were yesterday , as he came plodding to the inn door , his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow -- a tall , strong , heavy , nut-brown man , his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat , his hands ragged and scarred , with black , broken nails , and the sabre cut across one cheek , a dirty , livid white .\nI remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so , and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards : \" Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! \"\nin the high , old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars .\nThen he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried , and when my father appeared , called roughly for a glass of rum .\nThis , when it was brought to him , he drank slowly , like a connoisseur , lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard .\n\" This is a handy cove , \" says he at length ; \" and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop .\nMuch company , mate ? \"\nMy father told him no , very little company , the more was the pity .\n\" Well , then , \" said he , \" this is the berth for me .\nHere you , matey , \" he cried to the man who trundled the barrow ; \" bring up alongside and help up my chest .\nI 'll stay here a bit , \" he continued .\n\" I 'm a plain man ; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want , and that head up there for to watch ships off .\nWhat you mought call me ?\nYou mought call me captain .\nOh , I see what you 're at -- there \" ; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold .\n\" You can tell me when I 've worked through that , \" says he , looking as fierce as a commander .\nAnd indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke , he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast , but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike .\nThe man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the Royal George , that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast , and hearing ours well spoken of , I suppose , and described as lonely , had chosen it from the others for his place of residence .\nAnd that was all we could learn of our guest .\nHe was a very silent man by custom .\nAll day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope ; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong .\nMostly he would not speak when spoken to , only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn ; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be .\nEvery day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road .\nAt first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question , but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them .\nWhen a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow ( as now and then some did , making by the coast road for Bristol ) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour ; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present .\nFor me , at least , there was no secret about the matter , for I was , in a way , a sharer in his alarms .\nHe had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my \" weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg \" and let him know the moment he appeared .\nOften enough when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage , he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down , but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it , bring me my four-penny piece , and repeat his orders to look out for \" the seafaring man with one leg . \"\nHow that personage haunted my dreams , I need scarcely tell you .\nOn stormy nights , when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs , I would see him in a thousand forms , and with a thousand diabolical expressions .\nNow the leg would be cut off at the knee , now at the hip ; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg , and that in the middle of his body .\nTo see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares .\nAnd altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece , in the shape of these abominable fancies .\nBut though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg , I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him .\nThere were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry ; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked , old , wild sea-songs , minding nobody ; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing .\nOften I have heard the house shaking with \" Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum , \" all the neighbours joining in for dear life , with the fear of death upon them , and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark .\nFor in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known ; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round ; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question , or sometimes because none was put , and so he judged the company was not following his story .\nNor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed .\nHis stories were what frightened people worst of all .\nDreadful stories they were -- about hanging , and walking the plank , and storms at sea , and the Dry Tortugas , and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main .\nBy his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea , and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described .\nMy father was always saying the inn would be ruined , for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down , and sent shivering to their beds ; but I really believe his presence did us good .\nPeople were frightened at the time , but on looking back they rather liked it ; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life , and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him , calling him a \" true sea-dog \" and a \" real old salt \" and such like names , and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea .\nIn one way , indeed , he bade fair to ruin us , for he kept on staying week after week , and at last month after month , so that all the money had been long exhausted , and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more .\nIf ever he mentioned it , the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared , and stared my poor father out of the room .\nI have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff , and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death .\nAll the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker .\nOne of the cocks of his hat having fallen down , he let it hang from that day forth , though it was a great annoyance when it blew .\nI remember the appearance of his coat , which he patched himself upstairs in his room , and which , before the end , was nothing but patches .\nHe never wrote or received a letter , and he never spoke with any but the neighbours , and with these , for the most part , only when drunk on rum .\nThe great sea-chest none of us had ever seen open .\nHe was only once crossed , and that was towards the end , when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off .\nDr. Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient , took a bit of dinner from my mother , and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet , for we had no stabling at the old Benbow .\nI followed him in , and I remember observing the contrast the neat , bright doctor , with his powder as white as snow and his bright , black eyes and pleasant manners , made with the coltish country folk , and above all , with that filthy , heavy , bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours , sitting , far gone in rum , with his arms on the table .\nSuddenly he -- the captain , that is -- began to pipe up his eternal song : \" Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum !\nDrink and the devil had done for the rest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! \"\nAt first I had supposed \" the dead man 's chest \" to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room , and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man .\nBut by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song ; it was new , that night , to nobody but Dr. Livesey , and on him I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect , for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor , the gardener , on a new cure for the rheumatics .\nIn the meantime , the captain gradually brightened up at his own music , and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence .\nThe voices stopped at once , all but Dr. Livesey 's ; he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two .\nThe captain glared at him for a while , flapped his hand again , glared still harder , and at last broke out with a villainous , low oath , \" Silence , there , between decks ! \"\n",

    "BOOK I. MISS BROOKE .\nCHAPTER I. \" Since I can do no good because a woman , Reach constantly at something that is near it .\n-- The Maid 's Tragedy : BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER .\nMiss Brooke had that kind of beauty which seems to be thrown into relief by poor dress .\nHer hand and wrist were so finely formed that she could wear sleeves not less bare of style than those in which the Blessed Virgin appeared to Italian painters ; and her profile as well as her stature and bearing seemed to gain the more dignity from her plain garments , which by the side of provincial fashion gave her the impressiveness of a fine quotation from the Bible , -- or from one of our elder poets , -- in a paragraph of to-day 's newspaper .\nShe was usually spoken of as being remarkably clever , but with the addition that her sister Celia had more common-sense .\nNevertheless , Celia wore scarcely more trimmings ; and it was only to close observers that her dress differed from her sister 's , and had a shade of coquetry in its arrangements ; for Miss Brooke 's plain dressing was due to mixed conditions , in most of which her sister shared .\nThe pride of being ladies had something to do with it : the Brooke connections , though not exactly aristocratic , were unquestionably \" good : \" if you inquired backward for a generation or two , you would not find any yard-measuring or parcel-tying forefathers -- anything lower than an admiral or a clergyman ; and there was even an ancestor discernible as a Puritan gentleman who served under Cromwell , but afterwards conformed , and managed to come out of all political troubles as the proprietor of a respectable family estate .\nYoung women of such birth , living in a quiet country-house , and attending a village church hardly larger than a parlor , naturally regarded frippery as the ambition of a huckster 's daughter .\nThen there was well-bred economy , which in those days made show in dress the first item to be deducted from , when any margin was required for expenses more distinctive of rank .\nSuch reasons would have been enough to account for plain dress , quite apart from religious feeling ; but in Miss Brooke 's case , religion alone would have determined it ; and Celia mildly acquiesced in all her sister 's sentiments , only infusing them with that common-sense which is able to accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation .\nDorothea knew many passages of Pascal 's Pensees and of Jeremy Taylor by heart ; and to her the destinies of mankind , seen by the light of Christianity , made the solicitudes of feminine fashion appear an occupation for Bedlam .\nShe could not reconcile the anxieties of a spiritual life involving eternal consequences , with a keen interest in gimp and artificial protrusions of drapery .\nHer mind was theoretic , and yearned by its nature after some lofty conception of the world which might frankly include the parish of Tipton and her own rule of conduct there ; she was enamoured of intensity and greatness , and rash in embracing whatever seemed to her to have those aspects ; likely to seek martyrdom , to make retractations , and then to incur martyrdom after all in a quarter where she had not sought it .\nCertainly such elements in the character of a marriageable girl tended to interfere with her lot , and hinder it from being decided according to custom , by good looks , vanity , and merely canine affection .\nWith all this , she , the elder of the sisters , was not yet twenty , and they had both been educated , since they were about twelve years old and had lost their parents , on plans at once narrow and promiscuous , first in an English family and afterwards in a Swiss family at Lausanne , their bachelor uncle and guardian trying in this way to remedy the disadvantages of their orphaned condition .\nIt was hardly a year since they had come to live at Tipton Grange with their uncle , a man nearly sixty , of acquiescent temper , miscellaneous opinions , and uncertain vote .\nHe had travelled in his younger years , and was held in this part of the county to have contracted a too rambling habit of mind .\nMr. Brooke 's conclusions were as difficult to predict as the weather : it was only safe to say that he would act with benevolent intentions , and that he would spend as little money as possible in carrying them out .\nFor the most glutinously indefinite minds enclose some hard grains of habit ; and a man has been seen lax about all his own interests except the retention of his snuff-box , concerning which he was watchful , suspicious , and greedy of clutch .\nIn Mr. Brooke the hereditary strain of Puritan energy was clearly in abeyance ; but in his niece Dorothea it glowed alike through faults and virtues , turning sometimes into impatience of her uncle 's talk or his way of \" letting things be \" on his estate , and making her long all the more for the time when she would be of age and have some command of money for generous schemes .\nShe was regarded as an heiress ; for not only had the sisters seven hundred a-year each from their parents , but if Dorothea married and had a son , that son would inherit Mr. Brooke 's estate , presumably worth about three thousand a-year -- a rental which seemed wealth to provincial families , still discussing Mr. Peel 's late conduct on the Catholic question , innocent of future gold-fields , and of that gorgeous plutocracy which has so nobly exalted the necessities of genteel life .\nAnd how should Dorothea not marry ?\n-- a girl so handsome and with such prospects ?\nNothing could hinder it but her love of extremes , and her insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer , or even might lead her at last to refuse all offers .\nA young lady of some birth and fortune , who knelt suddenly down on a brick floor by the side of a sick laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the time of the Apostles -- who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist , and of sitting up at night to read old theological books !\nSuch a wife might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the application of her income which would interfere with political economy and the keeping of saddle-horses : a man would naturally think twice before he risked himself in such fellowship .\nWomen were expected to have weak opinions ; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic life was , that opinions were not acted on .\nSane people did what their neighbors did , so that if any lunatics were at large , one might know and avoid them .\nThe rural opinion about the new young ladies , even among the cottagers , was generally in favor of Celia , as being so amiable and innocent-looking , while Miss Brooke 's large eyes seemed , like her religion , too unusual and striking .\nPoor Dorothea !\ncompared with her , the innocent-looking Celia was knowing and worldly-wise ; so much subtler is a human mind than the outside tissues which make a sort of blazonry or clock-face for it .\nYet those who approached Dorothea , though prejudiced against her by this alarming hearsay , found that she had a charm unaccountably reconcilable with it .\nMost men thought her bewitching when she was on horseback .\nShe loved the fresh air and the various aspects of the country , and when her eyes and cheeks glowed with mingled pleasure she looked very little like a devotee .\nRiding was an indulgence which she allowed herself in spite of conscientious qualms ; she felt that she enjoyed it in a pagan sensuous way , and always looked forward to renouncing it .\nShe was open , ardent , and not in the least self-admiring ; indeed , it was pretty to see how her imagination adorned her sister Celia with attractions altogether superior to her own , and if any gentleman appeared to come to the Grange from some other motive than that of seeing Mr. Brooke , she concluded that he must be in love with Celia : Sir James Chettam , for example , whom she constantly considered from Celia 's point of view , inwardly debating whether it would be good for Celia to accept him .\nThat he should be regarded as a suitor to herself would have seemed to her a ridiculous irrelevance .\nDorothea , with all her eagerness to know the truths of life , retained very childlike ideas about marriage .\nShe felt sure that she would have accepted the judicious Hooker , if she had been born in time to save him from that wretched mistake he made in matrimony ; or John Milton when his blindness had come on ; or any of the other great men whose odd habits it would have been glorious piety to endure ; but an amiable handsome baronet , who said \" Exactly \" to her remarks even when she expressed uncertainty , -- how could he affect her as a lover ?\nThe really delightful marriage must be that where your husband was a sort of father , and could teach you even Hebrew , if you wished it .\nThese peculiarities of Dorothea 's character caused Mr. Brooke to be all the more blamed in neighboring families for not securing some middle-aged lady as guide and companion to his nieces .\nBut he himself dreaded so much the sort of superior woman likely to be available for such a position , that he allowed himself to be dissuaded by Dorothea 's objections , and was in this case brave enough to defy the world -- that is to say , Mrs. Cadwallader the Rector 's wife , and the small group of gentry with whom he visited in the northeast corner of Loamshire .\nSo Miss Brooke presided in her uncle 's household , and did not at all dislike her new authority , with the homage that belonged to it .\nSir James Chettam was going to dine at the Grange to-day with another gentleman whom the girls had never seen , and about whom Dorothea felt some venerating expectation .\nThis was the Reverend Edward Casaubon , noted in the county as a man of profound learning , understood for many years to be engaged on a great work concerning religious history ; also as a man of wealth enough to give lustre to his piety , and having views of his own which were to be more clearly ascertained on the publication of his book .\nHis very name carried an impressiveness hardly to be measured without a precise chronology of scholarship .\nEarly in the day Dorothea had returned from the infant school which she had set going in the village , and was taking her usual place in the pretty sitting-room which divided the bedrooms of the sisters , bent on finishing a plan for some buildings ( a kind of work which she delighted in ) , when Celia , who had been watching her with a hesitating desire to propose something , said --\n",

    "The \" Red Death \" had long devastated the country .\nNo pestilence had ever been so fatal , or so hideous .\nBlood was its Avatar and its seal -- the redness and the horror of blood .\nThere were sharp pains , and sudden dizziness , and then profuse bleeding at the pores , with dissolution .\nThe scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim , were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men .\nAnd the whole seizure , progress and termination of the disease , were the incidents of half an hour .\nBut the Prince Prospero was happy and dauntless and sagacious .\nWhen his dominions were half depopulated , he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court , and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys .\nThis was an extensive and magnificent structure , the creation of the prince 's own eccentric yet august taste .\nA strong and lofty wall girdled it in .\nThis wall had gates of iron .\nThe courtiers , having entered , brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts .\nThey resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within .\nThe abbey was amply provisioned .\nWith such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to contagion .\nThe external world could take care of itself .\nIn the meantime it was folly to grieve , or to think .\nThe prince had provided all the appliances of pleasure .\nThere were buffoons , there were improvisatori , there were ballet-dancers , there were musicians , there was Beauty , there was wine .\nAll these and security were within .\nWithout was the \" Red Death \" .\nIt was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion , and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad , that the Prince Prospero entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence .\nIt was a voluptuous scene , that masquerade .\nBut first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held .\nThese were seven -- an imperial suite .\nIn many palaces , however , such suites form a long and straight vista , while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand , so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded .\nHere the case was very different , as might have been expected from the duke 's love of the _ bizarre _ .\nThe apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time .\nThere was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards , and at each turn a novel effect .\nTo the right and left , in the middle of each wall , a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite .\nThese windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened .\nThat at the eastern extremity was hung , for example in blue -- and vividly blue were its windows .\nThe second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries , and here the panes were purple .\nThe third was green throughout , and so were the casements .\nThe fourth was furnished and lighted with orange -- the fifth with white -- the sixth with violet .\nThe seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls , falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue .\nBut in this chamber only , the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations .\nThe panes here were scarlet -- a deep blood colour .\nNow in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum , amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof .\nThere was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers .\nBut in the corridors that followed the suite , there stood , opposite to each window , a heavy tripod , bearing a brazier of fire , that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly illumined the room .\nAnd thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances .\nBut in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes , was ghastly in the extreme , and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered , that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all .\nIt was in this apartment , also , that there stood against the western wall , a gigantic clock of ebony .\nIts pendulum swung to and fro with a dull , heavy , monotonous clang ; and when the minute-hand made the circuit of the face , and the hour was to be stricken , there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical , but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that , at each lapse of an hour , the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause , momentarily , in their performance , to harken to the sound ; and thus the waltzers perforce ceased their evolutions ; and there was a brief disconcert of the whole gay company ; and , while the chimes of the clock yet rang , it was observed that the giddiest grew pale , and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation .\nBut when the echoes had fully ceased , a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly ; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly , and made whispering vows , each to the other , that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion ; and then , after the lapse of sixty minutes , ( which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies , ) there came yet another chiming of the clock , and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before .\nBut , in spite of these things , it was a gay and magnificent revel .\nThe tastes of the duke were peculiar .\nHe had a fine eye for colours and effects .\nHe disregarded the _ decora _ of mere fashion .\nHis plans were bold and fiery , and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre .\nThere are some who would have thought him mad .\nHis followers felt that he was not .\nIt was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be _ sure _ that he was not .\nHe had directed , in great part , the movable embellishments of the seven chambers , upon occasion of this great _ fête _ ; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the masqueraders .\nBe sure they were grotesque .\nThere were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm -- much of what has been since seen in \" Hernani \" .\nThere were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments .\nThere were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions .\nThere were much of the beautiful , much of the wanton , much of the _ bizarre _ , something of the terrible , and not a little of that which might have excited disgust .\nTo and fro in the seven chambers there stalked , in fact , a multitude of dreams .\nAnd these -- the dreams -- writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms , and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps .\nAnd , anon , there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet .\nAnd then , for a moment , all is still , and all is silent save the voice of the clock .\nThe dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand .\nBut the echoes of the chime die away -- they have endured but an instant -- and a light , half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart .\nAnd now again the music swells , and the dreams live , and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever , taking hue from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods .\nBut to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven , there are now none of the maskers who venture ; for the night is waning away ; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-coloured panes ; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals ; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet , there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches _ their _ ears who indulged in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments .\nBut these other apartments were densely crowded , and in them beat feverishly the heart of life .\nAnd the revel went whirlingly on , until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock .\nAnd then the music ceased , as I have told ; and the evolutions of the waltzers were quieted ; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before .\nBut now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock ; and thus it happened , perhaps , that more of thought crept , with more of time , into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled .\nAnd thus too , it happened , perhaps , that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence , there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before .\nAnd the rumour of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around , there arose at length from the whole company a buzz , or murmur , expressive of disapprobation and surprise -- then , finally , of terror , of horror , and of disgust .\nIn an assembly of phantasms such as I have painted , it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation .\nIn truth the masquerade licence of the night was nearly unlimited ; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod , and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince 's indefinite decorum .\nThere are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which can not be touched without emotion .\nEven with the utterly lost , to whom life and death are equally jests , there are matters of which no jest can be made .\nThe whole company , indeed , seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed .\nThe figure was tall and gaunt , and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave .\nThe mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat .\nAnd yet all this might have been endured , if not approved , by the mad revellers around .\nBut the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death .\nHis vesture was dabbled in _ blood _ -- and his broad brow , with all the features of the face , was besprinkled with the scarlet horror .\n",

    "CHAPTER I I MEET SIR HENRY CURTIS It is a curious thing that at my age -- fifty-five last birthday -- I should find myself taking up a pen to try to write a history .\nI wonder what sort of a history it will be when I have finished it , if ever I come to the end of the trip !\nI have done a good many things in my life , which seems a long one to me , owing to my having begun work so young , perhaps .\nAt an age when other boys are at school I was earning my living as a trader in the old Colony .\nI have been trading , hunting , fighting , or mining ever since .\nAnd yet it is only eight months ago that I made my pile .\nIt is a big pile now that I have got it -- I do n't yet know how big -- but I do not think I would go through the last fifteen or sixteen months again for it ; no , not if I knew that I should come out safe at the end , pile and all .\nBut then I am a timid man , and dislike violence ; moreover , I am almost sick of adventure .\nI wonder why I am going to write this book : it is not in my line .\nI am not a literary man , though very devoted to the Old Testament and also to the \" Ingoldsby Legends . \"\nLet me try to set down my reasons , just to see if I have any .\nFirst reason : Because Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good asked me .\nSecond reason : Because I am laid up here at Durban with the pain in my left leg .\nEver since that confounded lion got hold of me I have been liable to this trouble , and being rather bad just now , it makes me limp more than ever .\nThere must be some poison in a lion 's teeth , otherwise how is it that when your wounds are healed they break out again , generally , mark you , at the same time of year that you got your mauling ?\nIt is a hard thing when one has shot sixty-five lions or more , as I have in the course of my life , that the sixty-sixth should chew your leg like a quid of tobacco .\nIt breaks the routine of the thing , and putting other considerations aside , I am an orderly man and do n't like that .\nThis is by the way .\nThird reason : Because I want my boy Harry , who is over there at the hospital in London studying to become a doctor , to have something to amuse him and keep him out of mischief for a week or so .\nHospital work must sometimes pall and grow rather dull , for even of cutting up dead bodies there may come satiety , and as this history will not be dull , whatever else it may be , it will put a little life into things for a day or two while Harry is reading of our adventures .\nFourth reason and last : Because I am going to tell the strangest story that I remember .\nIt may seem a queer thing to say , especially considering that there is no woman in it -- except Foulata .\nStop , though !\nthere is Gagaoola , if she was a woman , and not a fiend .\nBut she was a hundred at least , and therefore not marriageable , so I do n't count her .\nAt any rate , I can safely say that there is not a _ petticoat _ in the whole history .\nWell , I had better come to the yoke .\nIt is a stiff place , and I feel as though I were bogged up to the axle .\nBut , \" _ sutjes , sutjes _ , \" as the Boers say -- I am sure I do n't know how they spell it -- softly does it .\nA strong team will come through at last , that is , if they are not too poor .\nYou can never do anything with poor oxen .\nNow to make a start .\nI , Allan Quatermain , of Durban , Natal , Gentleman , make oath and say -- That 's how I headed my deposition before the magistrate about poor Khiva 's and Ventvögel 's sad deaths ; but somehow it does n't seem quite the right way to begin a book .\nAnd , besides , am I a gentleman ?\nWhat is a gentleman ?\nI do n't quite know , and yet I have had to do with niggers -- no , I will scratch out that word \" niggers , \" for I do not like it .\nI 've known natives who _ are _ , and so you will say , Harry , my boy , before you have done with this tale , and I have known mean whites with lots of money and fresh out from home , too , who _ are not _ .\nAt any rate , I was born a gentleman , though I have been nothing but a poor travelling trader and hunter all my life .\nWhether I have remained so I known not , you must judge of that .\nHeaven knows I 've tried .\nI have killed many men in my time , yet I have never slain wantonly or stained my hand in innocent blood , but only in self-defence .\nThe Almighty gave us our lives , and I suppose He meant us to defend them , at least I have always acted on that , and I hope it will not be brought up against me when my clock strikes .\nThere , there , it is a cruel and a wicked world , and for a timid man I have been mixed up in a great deal of fighting .\nI can not tell the rights of it , but at any rate I have never stolen , though once I cheated a Kafir out of a herd of cattle .\nBut then he had done me a dirty turn , and it has troubled me ever since into the bargain .\nWell , it is eighteen months or so ago since first I met Sir Henry Curtis and Captain Good .\nIt was in this way .\nI had been up elephant hunting beyond Bamangwato , and had met with bad luck .\nEverything went wrong that trip , and to top up with I got the fever badly .\nSo soon as I was well enough I trekked down to the Diamond Fields , sold such ivory as I had , together with my wagon and oxen , discharged my hunters , and took the post-cart to the Cape .\nAfter spending a week in Cape Town , finding that they overcharged me at the hotel , and having seen everything there was to see , including the botanical gardens , which seem to me likely to confer a great benefit on the country , and the new Houses of Parliament , which I expect will do nothing of the sort , I determined to go back to Natal by the _ Dunkeld _ , then lying at the docks waiting for the _ Edinburgh Castle _ due in from England .\nI took my berth and went aboard , and that afternoon the Natal passengers from the _ Edinburgh Castle _ transhipped , and we weighed and put to sea .\nAmong these passengers who came on board were two who excited my curiosity .\nOne , a gentleman of about thirty , was perhaps the biggest-chested and longest-armed man I ever saw .\nHe had yellow hair , a thick yellow beard , clear-cut features , and large grey eyes set deep in his head .\nI never saw a finer-looking man , and somehow he reminded me of an ancient Dane .\nNot that I know much of ancient Danes , though I knew a modern Dane who did me out of ten pounds ; but I remember once seeing a picture of some of those gentry , who , I take it , were a kind of white Zulus .\nThey were drinking out of big horns , and their long hair hung down their backs .\nAs I looked at my friend standing there by the companion-ladder , I thought that if he only let his grow a little , put one of those chain shirts on to his great shoulders , and took hold of a battle-axe and a horn mug , he might have sat as a model for that picture .\nAnd by the way it is a curious thing , and just shows how the blood will out , I discovered afterwards that Sir Henry Curtis , for that was the big man 's name , is of Danish blood .\n[ 1 ] He also reminded me strongly of somebody else , but at the time I could not remember who it was .\nThe other man , who stood talking to Sir Henry , was stout and dark , and of quite a different cut .\nI suspected at once that he was a naval officer ; I do n't know why , but it is difficult to mistake a navy man .\nI have gone shooting trips with several of them in the course of my life , and they have always proved themselves the best and bravest and nicest fellows I ever met , though sadly given , some of them , to the use of profane language .\nI asked a page or two back , what is a gentleman ?\nI 'll answer the question now : A Royal Naval officer is , in a general sort of way , though of course there may be a black sheep among them here and there .\nI fancy it is just the wide seas and the breath of God 's winds that wash their hearts and blow the bitterness out of their minds and make them what men ought to be .\nWell , to return , I proved right again ; I ascertained that the dark man _ was _ a naval officer , a lieutenant of thirty-one , who , after seventeen years ' service , had been turned out of her Majesty 's employ with the barren honour of a commander 's rank , because it was impossible that he should be promoted .\nThis is what people who serve the Queen have to expect : to be shot out into the cold world to find a living just when they are beginning really to understand their work , and to reach the prime of life .\nI suppose they do n't mind it , but for my own part I had rather earn my bread as a hunter .\nOne 's halfpence are as scarce perhaps , but you do not get so many kicks .\nThe officer 's name I found out -- by referring to the passengers ' lists -- was Good -- Captain John Good .\nHe was broad , of medium height , dark , stout , and rather a curious man to look at .\nHe was so very neat and so very clean-shaved , and he always wore an eye-glass in his right eye .\nIt seemed to grow there , for it had no string , and he never took it out except to wipe it .\nAt first I thought he used to sleep in it , but afterwards I found that this was a mistake .\nHe put it in his trousers pocket when he went to bed , together with his false teeth , of which he had two beautiful sets that , my own being none of the best , have often caused me to break the tenth commandment .\nBut I am anticipating .\n",

    "CHAPTER ONE PLAYING PILGRIMS \" Christmas wo n't be Christmas without any presents , \" grumbled Jo , lying on the rug .\n\" It 's so dreadful to be poor ! \"\nsighed Meg , looking down at her old dress .\n\" I do n't think it 's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things , and other girls nothing at all , \" added little Amy , with an injured sniff .\n\" We 've got Father and Mother , and each other , \" said Beth contentedly from her corner .\nThe four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words , but darkened again as Jo said sadly , \" We have n't got Father , and shall not have him for a long time . \"\nShe did n't say \" perhaps never , \" but each silently added it , thinking of Father far away , where the fighting was .\nNobody spoke for a minute ; then Meg said in an altered tone , \" You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone ; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure , when our men are suffering so in the army .\nWe ca n't do much , but we can make our little sacrifices , and ought to do it gladly .\nBut I am afraid I do n't , \" and Meg shook her head , as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted .\n\" But I do n't think the little we should spend would do any good .\nWe 've each got a dollar , and the army would n't be much helped by our giving that .\nI agree not to expect anything from Mother or you , but I do want to buy _ Undine and Sintran _ for myself .\nI 've wanted it so long , \" said Jo , who was a bookworm .\n\" I planned to spend mine in new music , \" said Beth , with a little sigh , which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder .\n\" I shall get a nice box of Faber 's drawing pencils ; I really need them , \" said Amy decidedly .\n\" Mother did n't say anything about our money , and she wo n't wish us to give up everything .\nLet 's each buy what we want , and have a little fun ; I 'm sure we work hard enough to earn it , \" cried Jo , examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner .\n\" I know I do -- teaching those tiresome children nearly all day , when I 'm longing to enjoy myself at home , \" began Meg , in the complaining tone again .\n\" You do n't have half such a hard time as I do , \" said Jo .\n\" How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous , fussy old lady , who keeps you trotting , is never satisfied , and worries you till you 're ready to fly out the window or cry ? \"\n\" It 's naughty to fret , but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world .\nIt makes me cross , and my hands get so stiff , I ca n't practice well at all . \"\nAnd Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time .\n\" I do n't believe any of you suffer as I do , \" cried Amy , \" for you do n't have to go to school with impertinent girls , who plague you if you do n't know your lessons , and laugh at your dresses , and label your father if he is n't rich , and insult you when your nose is n't nice . \"\n\" If you mean libel , I 'd say so , and not talk about labels , as if Papa was a pickle bottle , \" advised Jo , laughing .\n\" I know what I mean , and you need n't be statirical about it .\nIt 's proper to use good words , and improve your vocabilary , \" returned Amy , with dignity .\n\" Do n't peck at one another , children .\nDo n't you wish we had the money Papa lost when we were little , Jo ?\nDear me !\nHow happy and good we 'd be , if we had no worries ! \"\nsaid Meg , who could remember better times .\n\" You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the King children , for they were fighting and fretting all the time , in spite of their money . \"\n\" So I did , Beth .\nWell , I think we are .\nFor though we do have to work , we make fun of ourselves , and are a pretty jolly set , as Jo would say . \"\n\" Jo does use such slang words ! \"\nobserved Amy , with a reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug .\nJo immediately sat up , put her hands in her pockets , and began to whistle .\n\" Do n't , Jo .\nIt 's so boyish ! \"\n\" That 's why I do it . \"\n\" I detest rude , unladylike girls ! \"\n\" I hate affected , niminy-piminy chits ! \"\n\" Birds in their little nests agree , \" sang Beth , the peacemaker , with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh , and the \" pecking \" ended for that time .\n\" Really , girls , you are both to be blamed , \" said Meg , beginning to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion .\n\" You are old enough to leave off boyish tricks , and to behave better , Josephine .\nIt did n't matter so much when you were a little girl , but now you are so tall , and turn up your hair , you should remember that you are a young lady . \"\n\" I 'm not !\nAnd if turning up my hair makes me one , I 'll wear it in two tails till I 'm twenty , \" cried Jo , pulling off her net , and shaking down a chestnut mane .\n\" I hate to think I 've got to grow up , and be Miss March , and wear long gowns , and look as prim as a China Aster !\nIt 's bad enough to be a girl , anyway , when I like boy 's games and work and manners !\nI ca n't get over my disappointment in not being a boy .\nAnd it 's worse than ever now , for I 'm dying to go and fight with Papa .\nAnd I can only stay home and knit , like a poky old woman ! \"\nAnd Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled like castanets , and her ball bounded across the room .\n\" Poor Jo !\nIt 's too bad , but it ca n't be helped .\nSo you must try to be contented with making your name boyish , and playing brother to us girls , \" said Beth , stroking the rough head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the world could not make ungentle in its touch .\n\" As for you , Amy , \" continued Meg , \" you are altogether too particular and prim .\nYour airs are funny now , but you 'll grow up an affected little goose , if you do n't take care .\nI like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking , when you do n't try to be elegant .\nBut your absurd words are as bad as Jo 's slang . \"\n\" If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose , what am I , please ? \"\nasked Beth , ready to share the lecture .\n\" You 're a dear , and nothing else , \" answered Meg warmly , and no one contradicted her , for the ' Mouse ' was the pet of the family .\nAs young readers like to know ' how people look ' , we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters , who sat knitting away in the twilight , while the December snow fell quietly without , and the fire crackled cheerfully within .\nIt was a comfortable room , though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain , for a good picture or two hung on the walls , books filled the recesses , chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows , and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it .\nMargaret , the eldest of the four , was sixteen , and very pretty , being plump and fair , with large eyes , plenty of soft brown hair , a sweet mouth , and white hands , of which she was rather vain .\nFifteen-year-old Jo was very tall , thin , and brown , and reminded one of a colt , for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs , which were very much in her way .\nShe had a decided mouth , a comical nose , and sharp , gray eyes , which appeared to see everything , and were by turns fierce , funny , or thoughtful .\nHer long , thick hair was her one beauty , but it was usually bundled into a net , to be out of her way .\nRound shoulders had Jo , big hands and feet , a flyaway look to her clothes , and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and did n't like it .\nElizabeth , or Beth , as everyone called her , was a rosy , smooth-haired , bright-eyed girl of thirteen , with a shy manner , a timid voice , and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed .\nHer father called her ' Little Miss Tranquility ' , and the name suited her excellently , for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own , only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved .\nAmy , though the youngest , was a most important person , in her own opinion at least .\nA regular snow maiden , with blue eyes , and yellow hair curling on her shoulders , pale and slender , and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners .\nWhat the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out .\nThe clock struck six and , having swept up the hearth , Beth put a pair of slippers down to warm .\nSomehow the sight of the old shoes had a good effect upon the girls , for Mother was coming , and everyone brightened to welcome her .\nMeg stopped lecturing , and lighted the lamp , Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked , and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers nearer to the blaze .\n\" They are quite worn out .\nMarmee must have a new pair . \"\n\" I thought I 'd get her some with my dollar , \" said Beth .\n",

    "CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , ‘ and what is the use of a book , ’ thought Alice ‘ without pictures or conversations ? ’\nSo she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .\nThere was nothing so VERY remarkable in that ; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself , ‘ Oh dear !\nOh dear !\nI shall be late ! ’\n( when she thought it over afterwards , it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the time it all seemed quite natural ) ; but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET , and looked at it , and then hurried on , Alice started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket , or a watch to take out of it , and burning with curiosity , she ran across the field after it , and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge .\nIn another moment down went Alice after it , never once considering how in the world she was to get out again .\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well .\nEither the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next .\nFirst , she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs .\nShe took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled ‘ ORANGE MARMALADE ’ , but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it .\n‘ Well ! ’\nthought Alice to herself , ‘ after such a fall as this , I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs !\nHow brave they ’ll all think me at home !\nWhy , I would n’t say anything about it , even if I fell off the top of the house ! ’\n( Which was very likely true . )\nDown , down , down .\nWould the fall NEVER come to an end !\n‘ I wonder how many miles I ’ve fallen by this time ? ’\nshe said aloud .\n‘ I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth .\nLet me see : that would be four thousand miles down , I think -- ’ ( for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over ) ‘ -- yes , that ’s about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I ’ve got to ? ’\n( Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say . )\nPresently she began again .\n‘ I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth !\nHow funny it ’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward !\nThe Antipathies , I think -- ’ ( she was rather glad there WAS no one listening , this time , as it did n’t sound at all the right word ) ‘ -- but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is , you know .\nPlease , Ma’am , is this New Zealand or Australia ? ’\n( and she tried to curtsey as she spoke -- fancy CURTSEYING as you ’re falling through the air !\nDo you think you could manage it ? )\n‘ And what an ignorant little girl she ’ll think me for asking !\nNo , it ’ll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere . ’\nDown , down , down .\nThere was nothing else to do , so Alice soon began talking again .\n‘ Dinah ’ll miss me very much to-night , I should think ! ’\n( Dinah was the cat . )\n‘ I hope they ’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time .\nDinah my dear !\nI wish you were down here with me !\nThere are no mice in the air , I ’m afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that ’s very like a mouse , you know .\nBut do cats eat bats , I wonder ? ’\nAnd here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way , ‘ Do cats eat bats ?\nDo cats eat bats ? ’\nand sometimes , ‘ Do bats eat cats ? ’\nfor , you see , as she could n’t answer either question , it did n’t much matter which way she put it .\nShe felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah , and saying to her very earnestly , ‘ Now , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? ’\nwhen suddenly , thump !\nthump !\ndown she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over .\nAlice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the White Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it .\nThere was not a moment to be lost : away went Alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , ‘ Oh my ears and whiskers , how late it ’s getting ! ’\nShe was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof .\nThere were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and Alice ’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas !\neither the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them .\nHowever , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat-hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw .\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; ‘ and even if my head would go through , ’ thought poor Alice , ‘ it would be of very little use without my shoulders .\nOh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope !\nI think I could , if I only knew how to begin . ’\nFor , you see , so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately , that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible .\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , [ ‘ which certainly was not here before , ’ said Alice , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words ‘ DRINK ME ’ beautifully printed on it in large letters .\nIt was all very well to say ‘ Drink me , ’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry .\n‘ No , I ’ll look first , ’ she said , ‘ and see whether it ’s marked “ poison ” or not ’ ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘ poison , ’ it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .\nHowever , this bottle was NOT marked ‘ poison , ’ so Alice ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart , custard , pine-apple , roast turkey , toffee , and hot buttered toast , ) she very soon finished it off .\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ‘ What a curious feeling ! ’\nsaid Alice ; ‘ I must be shutting up like a telescope . ’\nAnd so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden .\nFirst , however , she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; ‘ for it might end , you know , ’ said Alice to herself , ‘ in my going out altogether , like a candle .\nI wonder what I should be like then ? ’\nAnd she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing .\n",

    "CHAPTER I There was no possibility of taking a walk that day .\nWe had been wandering , indeed , in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning ; but since dinner ( Mrs. Reed , when there was no company , dined early ) the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre , and a rain so penetrating , that further out-door exercise was now out of the question .\nI was glad of it : I never liked long walks , especially on chilly afternoons : dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight , with nipped fingers and toes , and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie , the nurse , and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza , John , and Georgiana Reed .\nThe said Eliza , John , and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room : she lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside , and with her darlings about her ( for the time neither quarrelling nor crying ) looked perfectly happy .\nMe , she had dispensed from joining the group ; saying , \" She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance ; but that until she heard from Bessie , and could discover by her own observation , that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition , a more attractive and sprightly manner -- something lighter , franker , more natural , as it were -- she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented , happy , little children . \"\n\" What does Bessie say I have done ? \"\nI asked .\n\" Jane , I do n't like cavillers or questioners ; besides , there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner .\nBe seated somewhere ; and until you can speak pleasantly , remain silent . \"\nA breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room , I slipped in there .\nIt contained a bookcase : I soon possessed myself of a volume , taking care that it should be one stored with pictures .\nI mounted into the window - seat : gathering up my feet , I sat cross-legged , like a Turk ; and , having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close , I was shrined in double retirement .\nFolds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand ; to the left were the clear panes of glass , protecting , but not separating me from the drear November day .\nAt intervals , while turning over the leaves of my book , I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon .\nAfar , it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud ; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub , with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast .\nI returned to my book -- Bewick 's History of British Birds : the letterpress thereof I cared little for , generally speaking ; and yet there were certain introductory pages that , child as I was , I could not pass quite as a blank .\nThey were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl ; of \" the solitary rocks and promontories \" by them only inhabited ; of the coast of Norway , studded with isles from its southern extremity , the Lindeness , or Naze , to the North Cape -- \" Where the Northern Ocean , in vast whirls , Boils round the naked , melancholy isles Of farthest Thule ; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides . \"\nNor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland , Siberia , Spitzbergen , Nova Zembla , Iceland , Greenland , with \" the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone , and those forlorn regions of dreary space , -- that reservoir of frost and snow , where firm fields of ice , the accumulation of centuries of winters , glazed in Alpine heights above heights , surround the pole , and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold . \"\nOf these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own : shadowy , like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children 's brains , but strangely impressive .\nThe words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes , and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray ; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast ; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking .\nI can not tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard , with its inscribed headstone ; its gate , its two trees , its low horizon , girdled by a broken wall , and its newly-risen crescent , attesting the hour of eventide .\nThe two ships becalmed on a torpid sea , I believed to be marine phantoms .\nThe fiend pinning down the thief 's pack behind him , I passed over quickly : it was an object of terror .\nSo was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock , surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows .\nEach picture told a story ; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings , yet ever profoundly interesting : as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings , when she chanced to be in good humour ; and when , having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth , she allowed us to sit about it , and while she got up Mrs. Reed 's lace frills , and crimped her nightcap borders , fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads ; or ( as at a later period I discovered ) from the pages of Pamela , and Henry , Earl of Moreland .\nWith Bewick on my knee , I was then happy : happy at least in my way .\nI feared nothing but interruption , and that came too soon .\nThe breakfast - room door opened .\n\" Boh !\nMadam Mope ! \"\ncried the voice of John Reed ; then he paused : he found the room apparently empty .\n\" Where the dickens is she ! \"\nhe continued .\n\" Lizzy !\nGeorgy !\n( calling to his sisters ) Joan is not here : tell mama she is run out into the rain -- bad animal ! \"\n\" It is well I drew the curtain , \" thought I ; and I wished fervently he might not discover my hiding-place : nor would John Reed have found it out himself ; he was not quick either of vision or conception ; but Eliza just put her head in at the door , and said at once -- \" She is in the window-seat , to be sure , Jack . \"\nAnd I came out immediately , for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack .\n\" What do you want ? \"\nI asked , with awkward diffidence .\n\" Say , ' What do you want , Master Reed ? ' \"\nwas the answer .\n\" I want you to come here ; \" and seating himself in an arm-chair , he intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him .\nJohn Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old ; four years older than I , for I was but ten : large and stout for his age , with a dingy and unwholesome skin ; thick lineaments in a spacious visage , heavy limbs and large extremities .\nHe gorged himself habitually at table , which made him bilious , and gave him a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks .\nHe ought now to have been at school ; but his mama had taken him home for a month or two , \" on account of his delicate health . \"\nMr. Miles , the master , affirmed that he would do very well if he had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him from home ; but the mother 's heart turned from an opinion so harsh , and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John 's sallowness was owing to over-application and , perhaps , to pining after home .\nJohn had not much affection for his mother and sisters , and an antipathy to me .\nHe bullied and punished me ; not two or three times in the week , nor once or twice in the day , but continually : every nerve I had feared him , and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he came near .\nThere were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he inspired , because I had no appeal whatever against either his menaces or his inflictions ; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him , and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject : she never saw him strike or heard him abuse me , though he did both now and then in her very presence , more frequently , however , behind her back .\nHabitually obedient to John , I came up to his chair : he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots : I knew he would soon strike , and while dreading the blow , I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him who would presently deal it .\nI wonder if he read that notion in my face ; for , all at once , without speaking , he struck suddenly and strongly .\nI tottered , and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his chair .\n\" That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since , \" said he , \" and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains , and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since , you rat ! \"\nAccustomed to John Reed 's abuse , I never had an idea of replying to it ; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult .\n\" What were you doing behind the curtain ? \"\nhe asked .\n\" I was reading . \"\n\" Show the book . \"\nI returned to the window and fetched it thence .\n\" You have no business to take our books ; you are a dependent , mama says ; you have no money ; your father left you none ; you ought to beg , and not to live here with gentlemen 's children like us , and eat the same meals we do , and wear clothes at our mama 's expense .\nNow , I 'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves : for they _ are _ mine ; all the house belongs to me , or will do in a few years .\nGo and stand by the door , out of the way of the mirror and the windows . \"\nI did so , not at first aware what was his intention ; but when I saw him lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it , I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm : not soon enough , however ; the volume was flung , it hit me , and I fell , striking my head against the door and cutting it .\nThe cut bled , the pain was sharp : my terror had passed its climax ; other feelings succeeded .\n",

    "VOLUME I CHAPTER I Emma Woodhouse , handsome , clever , and rich , with a comfortable home and happy disposition , seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence ; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her .\nShe was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister 's marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .\nHer mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .\nSixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse 's family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .\nBetween _ them _ it was more the intimacy of sisters .\nEven before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor 's judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .\nThe real evils , indeed , of Emma 's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .\nThe danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .\nSorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .\n-- Miss Taylor married .\nIt was Miss Taylor 's loss which first brought grief .\nIt was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .\nThe wedding over , and the bride-people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening .\nHer father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .\nThe event had every promise of happiness for her friend .\nMr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character , easy fortune , suitable age , and pleasant manners ; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying , generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match ; but it was a black morning 's work for her .\nThe want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day .\nShe recalled her past kindness -- the kindness , the affection of sixteen years -- how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old -- how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health -- and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood .\nA large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella 's marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection .\nShe had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well-informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .\nHow was she to bear the change ?\n-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .\nShe dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her .\nHe could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages ( and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early ) was much increased by his constitution and habits ; for having been a valetudinarian all his life , without activity of mind or body , he was a much older man in ways than in years ; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper , his talents could not have recommended him at any time .\nHer sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again .\nHighbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .\nThe Woodhouses were first in consequence there .\nAll looked up to them .\nShe had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day .\nIt was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful .\nHis spirits required support .\nHe was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .\nMatrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter 's marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield .\nEmma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner , “ Poor Miss Taylor !\n-- I wish she were here again .\nWhat a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her ! ”\n“ I can not agree with you , papa ; you know I can not .\nMr. Weston is such a good-humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ; -- and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ? ”\n“ A house of her own !\n-- But where is the advantage of a house of her own ?\nThis is three times as large .\n-- And you have never any odd humours , my dear . ”\n“ How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !\n-- We shall be always meeting !\n_ We _ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon . ”\n“ My dear , how am I to get so far ?\nRandalls is such a distance .\nI could not walk half so far . ”\n“ No , papa , nobody thought of your walking .\nWe must go in the carriage , to be sure . ”\n“ The carriage !\nBut James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ; -- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ? ”\n“ They are to be put into Mr. Weston 's stable , papa .\nYou know we have settled all that already .\nWe talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night .\nAnd as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter 's being housemaid there .\nI only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .\nThat was your doing , papa .\nYou got Hannah that good place .\nNobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- James is so obliged to you ! ”\n“ I am very glad I did think of her .\nIt was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty-spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her .\nWhenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it .\nI am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .\nWhenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us .\nHe will be able to tell her how we all are . ”\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .\nThe backgammon-table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary .\nMr. Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella 's husband .\nHe lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London .\nHe had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square .\nIt was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time .\nMr. Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after “ poor Isabella ” and her children were answered most satisfactorily .\nWhen this was over , Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed , “ It is very kind of you , Mr. Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us .\nI am afraid you must have had a shocking walk . ”\n“",

    "Chapter I .\nThe Missing Heir .\n\" Uncle , you are not looking well to-night . \"\n\" I 'm not well , Florence .\nI sometimes doubt if I shall ever be any better . \"\n\" Surely , uncle , you can not mean ---- \" \" Yes , my child , I have reason to believe that I am nearing the end . \"\n\" I can not bear to hear you speak so , uncle , \" said Florence Linden , in irrepressible agitation .\n\" You are not an old man .\nYou are but fifty-four . \"\n\" True , Florence , but it is not years only that make a man old .\nTwo great sorrows have embittered my life .\nFirst , the death of my dearly beloved wife , and next , the loss of my boy , Harvey . \"\n\" It is long since I have heard you refer to my cousin 's loss .\nI thought you had become reconciled -- no , I do not mean that , -- I thought your regret might be less poignant . \"\n\" I have not permitted myself to speak of it , but I have never ceased to think of it day and night . \"\nJohn Linden paused sadly , then resumed : \" If he had died , I might , as you say , have become reconciled ; but he was abducted at the age of four by a revengeful servant whom I had discharged from my employment .\nHeaven knows whether he is living or dead , but it is impressed upon my mind that he still lives , it may be in misery , it may be as a criminal , while I , his unhappy father , live on in luxury which I can not enjoy , with no one to care for me ---- \" Florence Linden sank impulsively on her knees beside her uncle 's chair .\n\" Do n't say that , uncle , \" she pleaded .\n\" You know that I love you , Uncle John . \"\n\" And I , too , uncle . \"\nThere was a shade of jealousy in the voice of Curtis Waring as he entered the library through the open door , and approaching his uncle , pressed his hand .\nHe was a tall , dark-complexioned man , of perhaps thirty-five , with shifty , black eyes and thin lips , shaded by a dark mustache .\nIt was not a face to trust .\nEven when he smiled the expression of his face did not soften .\nYet he could moderate his voice so as to express tenderness and sympathy .\nHe was the son of an elder sister of Mr. Linden , while Florence was the daughter of a younger brother .\nBoth were orphans , and both formed a part of Mr. Linden 's household , and owed everything to his bounty .\nCurtis was supposed to be in some business downtown ; but he received a liberal allowance from his uncle , and often drew upon him for outside assistance .\nAs he stood with his uncle 's hand in his , he was necessarily brought near Florence , who instinctively drew a little away , with a slight shudder indicating repugnance .\nSlight as it was , Curtis detected it , and his face darkened .\nJohn Linden looked from one to the other .\n\" Yes , \" he said , \" I must not forget that I have a nephew and a niece .\nYou are both dear to me , but no one can take the place of the boy I have lost . \"\n\" But it is so long ago , uncle , \" said Curtis .\n\" It must be fourteen years . \"\n\" It is fourteen years . \"\n\" And the boy is long since dead ! \"\n\" No , no ! \" said John Linden , vehemently .\n\" I do not , I will not , believe it .\nHe still lives , and I live only in the hope of one day clasping him in my arms . \"\n\" That is very improbable , uncle , \" said Curtis , in a tone of annoyance .\n\" There is n't one chance in a hundred that my cousin still lives .\nThe grave has closed over him long since .\nThe sooner you make up your mind to accept the inevitable the better . \"\nThe drawn features of the old man showed that the words had a depressing effect upon his mind , but Florence interrupted her cousin with an indignant protest .\n\" How can you speak so , Curtis ? \" she exclaimed .\n\" Leave Uncle John the hope that he has so long cherished .\nI have a presentiment that Harvey still lives . \"\nJohn Linden 's face brightened up \" You , too , believe it possible , Florence ? \" he said , eagerly .\n\" Yes , uncle .\nI not only believe it possible , but probable .\nHow old would Harvey be if he still lived ? \"\n\" Eighteen -- nearly a year older than yourself . \"\n\" How strange !\nI always think of him as a little boy . \"\n\" And I , too , Florence .\nHe rises before me in his little velvet suit , as he was when I last saw him , with his sweet , boyish face , in which his mother 's looks were reflected . \"\n\" Yet , if still living , \" interrupted Curtis , harshly , \" he is a rough street boy , perchance serving his time at Blackwell 's Island , and , a hardened young ruffian , whom it would be bitter mortification to recognize as your son . \"\n\" That 's the sorrowful part of it , \" said his uncle , in a voice of anguish .\n\" That is what I most dread . \"\n\" Then , since even if he were living you would not care to recognize him , why not cease to think of him , or else regard him as dead ? \"\n\" Curtis Waring , have you no heart ? \" demanded Florence , indignantly .\n\" Indeed , Florence , you ought to know , \" said Curtis , sinking his voice into softly modulated accents .\n\" I know nothing of it , \" said Florence , coldly , rising from her recumbent position , and drawing aloof from Curtis .\n\" You know that the dearest wish of my heart is to find favor in your eyes .\nUncle , you know my wish , and approve of it , do you not ? \"\n\" Yes , Curtis ; you and Florence are equally dear to me , and it is my hope that you may be united .\nIn that case , there will be no division of my fortune .\nIt will be left to you jointly . \"\n\" Believe me , sir , \" said Curtis , with faltering voice , feigning an emotion which he did not feel , \" believe me , that I fully appreciate your goodness .\nI am sure Florence joins with me ---- \" \" Florence can speak for herself , \" said his cousin , coldly .\n\" My uncle needs no assurance from me .\nHe is always kind , and I am always grateful . \"\nJohn Linden seemed absorbed in thought .\n\" I do not doubt your affection , \" he said ; \" and I have shown it by making you my joint heirs in the event of your marriage ; but it is only fair to say that my property goes to my boy , if he still lives . \"\n\" But , sir , \" protested Curtis , \" is not that likely to create unnecessary trouble ?\nIt can never be known , and meanwhile ---- \" \" You and Florence will hold the property in trust . \"\n\" Have you so specified in your will ? \" asked Curtis .\n\" I have made two wills .\nBoth are in yonder secretary .\nBy the first the property is bequeathed to you and Florence .\nBy the second and later , it goes to my lost boy in the event of his recovery .\nOf course , you and Florence are not forgotten , but the bulk of the property goes to Harvey . \"\n\" I sincerely wish the boy might be restored to you , \" said Curtis ; but his tone belied his words .\n\" Believe me , the loss of the property would affect me little , if you could be made happy by realizing your warmest desire ; but , uncle , I think it only the part of a friend to point out to you , as I have already done , the baselessness of any such expectation . \"\n\" It may be as you say , Curtis , \" said his uncle , with a sigh .\n\" If I were thoroughly convinced of it , I would destroy the later will , and leave my property absolutely to you and Florence . \"\n\" No , uncle , \" said Florence , impulsively , \" make no change ; let the will stand . \"\nCurtis , screened from his uncle 's view , darted a glance of bitter indignation at Florence .\n\" Is the girl mad ? \" he muttered to himself .\n\" Must she forever balk me ? \"\n\" Let it be so for the present , then , \" said Mr. Linden , wearily .\n\" Curtis , will you ring the bell ?\nI am tired , and shall retire to my couch early . \"\n\" Let me help you , Uncle John , \" said Florence , eagerly .\n\" It is too much for your strength , my child .\nI am growing more and more helpless . \"\n\" I , too , can help , \" said Curtis .\nJohn Linden , supported on either side by his nephew and niece , left the room , and was assisted to his chamber .\nCurtis and Florence returned to the library .\n\" Florence , \" said her cousin , \" my uncle 's intentions , as expressed to-night , make it desirable that there should be an understanding between us .\nTake a seat beside me \" -- leading her to a sofa -- \" and let us talk this matter over . \"\nWith a gesture of repulsion Florence declined the proffered seat , and remained standing .\n\" As you please , \" she answered , coldly .\n\" Will you be seated ? \"\n\" No ; our interview will be brief . \"\n\" Then I will come to the point .\nUncle John wishes to see us united . \"\n\" It can never be ! \" said Florence , decidedly .\nCurtis bit his lip in mortification , for her tone was cold and scornful .\nMingled with this mortification was genuine regret , for , so far as he was capable of loving any one , he loved his fair young cousin .\n\" You profess to love Uncle John , and yet you would disappoint his cherished hope ! \" he returned .\n\" Is it his cherished hope ? \"\n\" There is no doubt about it .\nHe has spoken to me more than once on the subject .\nFeeling that his end is near , he wishes to leave you in charge of a protector . \"\n",

    "CHAPTER I When I was a small boy at the beginning of the century I remember an old man who wore knee-breeches and worsted stockings , and who used to hobble about the street of our village with the help of a stick .\nHe must have been getting on for eighty in the year 1807 , earlier than which date I suppose I can hardly remember him , for I was born in 1802 .\nA few white locks hung about his ears , his shoulders were bent and his knees feeble , but he was still hale , and was much respected in our little world of Paleham .\nHis name was Pontifex .\nHis wife was said to be his master ; I have been told she brought him a little money , but it can not have been much .\nShe was a tall , square-shouldered person ( I have heard my father call her a Gothic woman ) who had insisted on being married to Mr Pontifex when he was young and too good-natured to say nay to any woman who wooed him .\nThe pair had lived not unhappily together , for Mr Pontifex 's temper was easy and he soon learned to bow before his wife 's more stormy moods .\nMr Pontifex was a carpenter by trade ; he was also at one time parish clerk ; when I remember him , however , he had so far risen in life as to be no longer compelled to work with his own hands .\nIn his earlier days he had taught himself to draw .\nI do not say he drew well , but it was surprising he should draw as well as he did .\nMy father , who took the living of Paleham about the year 1797 , became possessed of a good many of old Mr Pontifex 's drawings , which were always of local subjects , and so unaffectedly painstaking that they might have passed for the work of some good early master .\nI remember them as hanging up framed and glazed in the study at the Rectory , and tinted , as all else in the room was tinted , with the green reflected from the fringe of ivy leaves that grew around the windows .\nI wonder how they will actually cease and come to an end as drawings , and into what new phases of being they will then enter .\nNot content with being an artist , Mr Pontifex must needs also be a musician .\nHe built the organ in the church with his own hands , and made a smaller one which he kept in his own house .\nHe could play as much as he could draw , not very well according to professional standards , but much better than could have been expected .\nI myself showed a taste for music at an early age , and old Mr Pontifex on finding it out , as he soon did , became partial to me in consequence .\nIt may be thought that with so many irons in the fire he could hardly be a very thriving man , but this was not the case .\nHis father had been a day labourer , and he had himself begun life with no other capital than his good sense and good constitution ; now , however , there was a goodly show of timber about his yard , and a look of solid comfort over his whole establishment .\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century and not long before my father came to Paleham , he had taken a farm of about ninety acres , thus making a considerable rise in life .\nAlong with the farm there went an old-fashioned but comfortable house with a charming garden and an orchard .\nThe carpenter 's business was now carried on in one of the outhouses that had once been part of some conventual buildings , the remains of which could be seen in what was called the Abbey Close .\nThe house itself , embosomed in honeysuckles and creeping roses , was an ornament to the whole village , nor were its internal arrangements less exemplary than its outside was ornamental .\nReport said that Mrs Pontifex starched the sheets for her best bed , and I can well believe it .\nHow well do I remember her parlour half filled with the organ which her husband had built , and scented with a withered apple or two from the _ pyrus japonica _ that grew outside the house ; the picture of the prize ox over the chimney-piece , which Mr Pontifex himself had painted ; the transparency of the man coming to show light to a coach upon a snowy night , also by Mr Pontifex ; the little old man and little old woman who told the weather ; the china shepherd and shepherdess ; the jars of feathery flowering grasses with a peacock 's feather or two among them to set them off , and the china bowls full of dead rose leaves dried with bay salt .\nAll has long since vanished and become a memory , faded but still fragrant to myself .\nNay , but her kitchen -- and the glimpses into a cavernous cellar beyond it , wherefrom came gleams from the pale surfaces of milk cans , or it may be of the arms and face of a milkmaid skimming the cream ; or again her storeroom , where among other treasures she kept the famous lipsalve which was one of her especial glories , and of which she would present a shape yearly to those whom she delighted to honour .\nShe wrote out the recipe for this and gave it to my mother a year or two before she died , but we could never make it as she did .\nWhen we were children she used sometimes to send her respects to my mother , and ask leave for us to come and take tea with her .\nRight well she used to ply us .\nAs for her temper , we never met such a delightful old lady in our lives ; whatever Mr Pontifex may have had to put up with , we had no cause for complaint , and then Mr Pontifex would play to us upon the organ , and we would stand round him open-mouthed and think him the most wonderfully clever man that ever was born , except of course our papa .\nMrs Pontifex had no sense of humour , at least I can call to mind no signs of this , but her husband had plenty of fun in him , though few would have guessed it from his appearance .\nI remember my father once sent me down to his workship to get some glue , and I happened to come when old Pontifex was in the act of scolding his boy .\nHe had got the lad -- a pudding-headed fellow -- by the ear and was saying , \" What ?\nLost again -- smothered o ' wit . \"\n( I believe it was the boy who was himself supposed to be a wandering soul , and who was thus addressed as lost . )\n\" Now , look here , my lad , \" he continued , \" some boys are born stupid , and thou art one of them ; some achieve stupidity -- that 's thee again , Jim -- thou wast both born stupid and hast greatly increased thy birthright -- and some \" ( and here came a climax during which the boy 's head and ear were swayed from side to side ) \" have stupidity thrust upon them , which , if it please the Lord , shall not be thy case , my lad , for I will thrust stupidity from thee , though I have to box thine ears in doing so , \" but I did not see that the old man really did box Jim 's ears , or do more than pretend to frighten him , for the two understood one another perfectly well .\nAnother time I remember hearing him call the village rat-catcher by saying , \" Come hither , thou three-days-and-three-nights , thou , \" alluding , as I afterwards learned , to the rat-catcher 's periods of intoxication ; but I will tell no more of such trifles .\nMy father 's face would always brighten when old Pontifex 's name was mentioned .\n\" I tell you , Edward , \" he would say to me , \" old Pontifex was not only an able man , but he was one of the very ablest men that ever I knew . \"\nThis was more than I as a young man was prepared to stand .\n\" My dear father , \" I answered , \" what did he do ?\nHe could draw a little , but could he to save his life have got a picture into the Royal Academy exhibition ?\nHe built two organs and could play the Minuet in _ Samson _ on one and the March in _ Scipio _ on the other ; he was a good carpenter and a bit of a wag ; he was a good old fellow enough , but why make him out so much abler than he was ? \"\n\" My boy , \" returned my father , \" you must not judge by the work , but by the work in connection with the surroundings .\nCould Giotto or Filippo Lippi , think you , have got a picture into the Exhibition ?\nWould a single one of those frescoes we went to see when we were at Padua have the remotest chance of being hung , if it were sent in for exhibition now ?\nWhy , the Academy people would be so outraged that they would not even write to poor Giotto to tell him to come and take his fresco away .\nPhew ! \"\ncontinued he , waxing warm , \" if old Pontifex had had Cromwell 's chances he would have done all that Cromwell did , and have done it better ; if he had had Giotto 's chances he would have done all that Giotto did , and done it no worse ; as it was , he was a village carpenter , and I will undertake to say he never scamped a job in the whole course of his life . \"\n\" But , \" said I , \" we can not judge people with so many ' ifs . '\nIf old Pontifex had lived in Giotto 's time he might have been another Giotto , but he did not live in Giotto 's time . \"\n\" I tell you , Edward , \" said my father with some severity , \" we must judge men not so much by what they do , as by what they make us feel that they have it in them to do .\nIf a man has done enough either in painting , music or the affairs of life , to make me feel that I might trust him in an emergency he has done enough .\nIt is not by what a man has actually put upon his canvas , nor yet by the acts which he has set down , so to speak , upon the canvas of his life that I will judge him , but by what he makes me feel that he felt and aimed at .\nIf he has made me feel that he felt those things to be loveable which I hold loveable myself I ask no more ; his grammar may have been imperfect , but still I have understood him ; he and I are _ en rapport _ ; and I say again , Edward , that old Pontifex was not only an able man , but one of the very ablest men I ever knew . \"\n",

    "PART ONE Chapter I : The Bertolini “ The Signora had no business to do it , ” said Miss Bartlett , “ no business at all .\nShe promised us south rooms with a view close together , instead of which here are north rooms , looking into a courtyard , and a long way apart .\nOh , Lucy ! ”\n“ And a Cockney , besides ! ”\nsaid Lucy , who had been further saddened by the Signora ’s unexpected accent .\n“ It might be London . ”\nShe looked at the two rows of English people who were sitting at the table ; at the row of white bottles of water and red bottles of wine that ran between the English people ; at the portraits of the late Queen and the late Poet Laureate that hung behind the English people , heavily framed ; at the notice of the English church ( Rev. Cuthbert Eager , M. A. Oxon . )\n, that was the only other decoration of the wall .\n“ Charlotte , do n’t you feel , too , that we might be in London ?\nI can hardly believe that all kinds of other things are just outside .\nI suppose it is one ’s being so tired . ”\n“ This meat has surely been used for soup , ” said Miss Bartlett , laying down her fork .\n“ I want so to see the Arno .\nThe rooms the Signora promised us in her letter would have looked over the Arno .\nThe Signora had no business to do it at all .\nOh , it is a shame ! ”\n“ Any nook does for me , ” Miss Bartlett continued ; “ but it does seem hard that you should n’t have a view . ”\nLucy felt that she had been selfish .\n“ Charlotte , you must n’t spoil me : of course , you must look over the Arno , too .\nI meant that .\nThe first vacant room in the front -- ” “ You must have it , ” said Miss Bartlett , part of whose travelling expenses were paid by Lucy ’s mother -- a piece of generosity to which she made many a tactful allusion .\n“ No , no .\nYou must have it . ”\n“ I insist on it .\nYour mother would never forgive me , Lucy . ”\n“ She would never forgive me . ”\nThe ladies ’ voices grew animated , and -- if the sad truth be owned -- a little peevish .\nThey were tired , and under the guise of unselfishness they wrangled .\nSome of their neighbours interchanged glances , and one of them -- one of the ill-bred people whom one does meet abroad -- leant forward over the table and actually intruded into their argument .\nHe said : “ I have a view , I have a view . ”\nMiss Bartlett was startled .\nGenerally at a pension people looked them over for a day or two before speaking , and often did not find out that they would “ do ” till they had gone .\nShe knew that the intruder was ill-bred , even before she glanced at him .\nHe was an old man , of heavy build , with a fair , shaven face and large eyes .\nThere was something childish in those eyes , though it was not the childishness of senility .\nWhat exactly it was Miss Bartlett did not stop to consider , for her glance passed on to his clothes .\nThese did not attract her .\nHe was probably trying to become acquainted with them before they got into the swim .\nSo she assumed a dazed expression when he spoke to her , and then said : “ A view ?\nOh , a view !\nHow delightful a view is ! ”\n“ This is my son , ” said the old man ; “ his name ’s George .\nHe has a view too . ”\n“ Ah , ” said Miss Bartlett , repressing Lucy , who was about to speak .\n“ What I mean , ” he continued , “ is that you can have our rooms , and we ’ll have yours .\nWe ’ll change . ”\nThe better class of tourist was shocked at this , and sympathized with the new-comers .\nMiss Bartlett , in reply , opened her mouth as little as possible , and said “ Thank you very much indeed ; that is out of the question . ”\n“ Why ? ”\nsaid the old man , with both fists on the table .\n“ Because it is quite out of the question , thank you . ”\n“ You see , we do n’t like to take -- ” began Lucy .\nHer cousin again repressed her .\n“ But why ? ”\nhe persisted .\n“ Women like looking at a view ; men do n’t . ”\nAnd he thumped with his fists like a naughty child , and turned to his son , saying , “ George , persuade them ! ”\n“ It ’s so obvious they should have the rooms , ” said the son .\n“ There ’s nothing else to say . ”\nHe did not look at the ladies as he spoke , but his voice was perplexed and sorrowful .\nLucy , too , was perplexed ; but she saw that they were in for what is known as “ quite a scene , ” and she had an odd feeling that whenever these ill-bred tourists spoke the contest widened and deepened till it dealt , not with rooms and views , but with -- well , with something quite different , whose existence she had not realized before .\nNow the old man attacked Miss Bartlett almost violently : Why should she not change ?\nWhat possible objection had she ?\nThey would clear out in half an hour .\nMiss Bartlett , though skilled in the delicacies of conversation , was powerless in the presence of brutality .\nIt was impossible to snub any one so gross .\nHer face reddened with displeasure .\nShe looked around as much as to say , “ Are you all like this ? ”\nAnd two little old ladies , who were sitting further up the table , with shawls hanging over the backs of the chairs , looked back , clearly indicating “ We are not ; we are genteel . ”\n“ Eat your dinner , dear , ” she said to Lucy , and began to toy again with the meat that she had once censured .\nLucy mumbled that those seemed very odd people opposite .\n“ Eat your dinner , dear .\nThis pension is a failure .\nTo-morrow we will make a change . ”\nHardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it .\nThe curtains at the end of the room parted , and revealed a clergyman , stout but attractive , who hurried forward to take his place at the table , cheerfully apologizing for his lateness .\nLucy , who had not yet acquired decency , at once rose to her feet , exclaiming : “ Oh , oh !\nWhy , it ’s Mr. Beebe !\nOh , how perfectly lovely !\nOh , Charlotte , we must stop now , however bad the rooms are .\nOh ! ”\nMiss Bartlett said , with more restraint : “ How do you do , Mr. Beebe ?\nI expect that you have forgotten us : Miss Bartlett and Miss Honeychurch , who were at Tunbridge Wells when you helped the Vicar of St. Peter ’s that very cold Easter . ”\nThe clergyman , who had the air of one on a holiday , did not remember the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him .\nBut he came forward pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by Lucy .\n“ I AM so glad to see you , ” said the girl , who was in a state of spiritual starvation , and would have been glad to see the waiter if her cousin had permitted it .\n“ Just fancy how small the world is .\nSummer Street , too , makes it so specially funny . ”\n“ Miss Honeychurch lives in the parish of Summer Street , ” said Miss Bartlett , filling up the gap , “ and she happened to tell me in the course of conversation that you have just accepted the living -- ” “ Yes , I heard from mother so last week .\nShe did n’t know that I knew you at Tunbridge Wells ; but I wrote back at once , and I said : ‘ Mr. Beebe is -- ’” “ Quite right , ” said the clergyman .\n“ I move into the Rectory at Summer Street next June .\nI am lucky to be appointed to such a charming neighbourhood . ”\n“ Oh , how glad I am !\nThe name of our house is Windy Corner . ”\nMr. Beebe bowed .\n“ There is mother and me generally , and my brother , though it ’s not often we get him to ch ---- The church is rather far off , I mean . ”\n“ Lucy , dearest , let Mr. Beebe eat his dinner . ”\n“ I am eating it , thank you , and enjoying it . ”\nHe preferred to talk to Lucy , whose playing he remembered , rather than to Miss Bartlett , who probably remembered his sermons .\nHe asked the girl whether she knew Florence well , and was informed at some length that she had never been there before .\nIt is delightful to advise a newcomer , and he was first in the field .\n“ Do n’t neglect the country round , ” his advice concluded .\n“ The first fine afternoon drive up to Fiesole , and round by Settignano , or something of that sort . ”\n“ No ! ”\ncried a voice from the top of the table .\n“ Mr. Beebe , you are wrong .\nThe first fine afternoon your ladies must go to Prato . ”\n“ That lady looks so clever , ” whispered Miss Bartlett to her cousin .\n“ We are in luck . ”\nAnd , indeed , a perfect torrent of information burst on them .\nPeople told them what to see , when to see it , how to stop the electric trams , how to get rid of the beggars , how much to give for a vellum blotter , how much the place would grow upon them .\nThe Pension Bertolini had decided , almost enthusiastically , that they would do .\nWhichever way they looked , kind ladies smiled and shouted at them .\nAnd above all rose the voice of the clever lady , crying : “ Prato !\nThey must go to Prato .\nThat place is too sweetly squalid for words .\nI love it ; I revel in shaking off the trammels of respectability , as you know . ”\nThe young man named George glanced at the clever lady , and then returned moodily to his plate .\nObviously he and his father did not do .\nLucy , in the midst of her success , found time to wish they did .\nIt gave her no extra pleasure that any one should be left in the cold ; and when she rose to go , she turned back and gave the two outsiders a nervous little bow .\n",

    "BOOK ONE CHAPTER I ANTHONY PATCH In 1913 , when Anthony Patch was twenty-five , two years were already gone since irony , the Holy Ghost of this later day , had , theoretically at least , descended upon him .\nIrony was the final polish of the shoe , the ultimate dab of the clothes-brush , a sort of intellectual \" There ! \"\n-- yet at the brink of this story he has as yet gone no further than the conscious stage .\nAs you first see him he wonders frequently whether he is not without honor and slightly mad , a shameful and obscene thinness glistening on the surface of the world like oil on a clean pond , these occasions being varied , of course , with those in which he thinks himself rather an exceptional young man , thoroughly sophisticated , well adjusted to his environment , and somewhat more significant than any one else he knows .\nThis was his healthy state and it made him cheerful , pleasant , and very attractive to intelligent men and to all women .\nIn this state he considered that he would one day accomplish some quiet subtle thing that the elect would deem worthy and , passing on , would join the dimmer stars in a nebulous , indeterminate heaven half-way between death and immortality .\nUntil the time came for this effort he would be Anthony Patch -- not a portrait of a man but a distinct and dynamic personality , opinionated , contemptuous , functioning from within outward -- a man who was aware that there could be no honor and yet had honor , who knew the sophistry of courage and yet was brave .\nA WORTHY MAN AND HIS GIFTED SON Anthony drew as much consciousness of social security from being the grandson of Adam J. Patch as he would have had from tracing his line over the sea to the crusaders .\nThis is inevitable ; Virginians and Bostonians to the contrary notwithstanding , an aristocracy founded sheerly on money postulates wealth in the particular .\nNow Adam J. Patch , more familiarly known as \" Cross Patch , \" left his father 's farm in Tarrytown early in sixty-one to join a New York cavalry regiment .\nHe came home from the war a major , charged into Wall Street , and amid much fuss , fume , applause , and ill will he gathered to himself some seventy-five million dollars .\nThis occupied his energies until he was fifty-seven years old .\nIt was then that he determined , after a severe attack of sclerosis , to consecrate the remainder of his life to the moral regeneration of the world .\nHe became a reformer among reformers .\nEmulating the magnificent efforts of Anthony Comstock , after whom his grandson was named , he levelled a varied assortment of uppercuts and body-blows at liquor , literature , vice , art , patent medicines , and Sunday theatres .\nHis mind , under the influence of that insidious mildew which eventually forms on all but the few , gave itself up furiously to every indignation of the age .\nFrom an armchair in the office of his Tarrytown estate he directed against the enormous hypothetical enemy , unrighteousness , a campaign which went on through fifteen years , during which he displayed himself a rabid monomaniac , an unqualified nuisance , and an intolerable bore .\nThe year in which this story opens found him wearying ; his campaign had grown desultory ; 1861 was creeping up slowly on 1895 ; his thoughts ran a great deal on the Civil War , somewhat on his dead wife and son , almost infinitesimally on his grandson Anthony .\nEarly in his career Adam Patch had married an anemic lady of thirty , Alicia Withers , who brought him one hundred thousand dollars and an impeccable entré into the banking circles of New York .\nImmediately and rather spunkily she had borne him a son and , as if completely devitalized by the magnificence of this performance , she had thenceforth effaced herself within the shadowy dimensions of the nursery .\nThe boy , Adam Ulysses Patch , became an inveterate joiner of clubs , connoisseur of good form , and driver of tandems -- at the astonishing age of twenty-six he began his memoirs under the title \" New York Society as I Have Seen It . \"\nOn the rumor of its conception this work was eagerly bid for among publishers , but as it proved after his death to be immoderately verbose and overpoweringly dull , it never obtained even a private printing .\nThis Fifth Avenue Chesterfield married at twenty-two .\nHis wife was Henrietta Lebrune , the Boston \" Society Contralto , \" and the single child of the union was , at the request of his grandfather , christened Anthony Comstock Patch .\nWhen he went to Harvard , the Comstock dropped out of his name to a nether hell of oblivion and was never heard of thereafter .\nYoung Anthony had one picture of his father and mother together -- so often had it faced his eyes in childhood that it had acquired the impersonality of furniture , but every one who came into his bedroom regarded it with interest .\nIt showed a dandy of the nineties , spare and handsome , standing beside a tall dark lady with a muff and the suggestion of a bustle .\nBetween them was a little boy with long brown curls , dressed in a velvet Lord Fauntleroy suit .\nThis was Anthony at five , the year of his mother 's death .\nHis memories of the Boston Society Contralto were nebulous and musical .\nShe was a lady who sang , sang , sang , in the music room of their house on Washington Square -- sometimes with guests scattered all about her , the men with their arms folded , balanced breathlessly on the edges of sofas , the women with their hands in their laps , occasionally making little whispers to the men and always clapping very briskly and uttering cooing cries after each song -- and often she sang to Anthony alone , in Italian or French or in a strange and terrible dialect which she imagined to be the speech of the Southern negro .\nHis recollections of the gallant Ulysses , the first man in America to roll the lapels of his coat , were much more vivid .\nAfter Henrietta Lebrune Patch had \" joined another choir , \" as her widower huskily remarked from time to time , father and son lived up at grampa 's in Tarrytown , and Ulysses came daily to Anthony 's nursery and expelled pleasant , thick-smelling words for sometimes as much as an hour .\nHe was continually promising Anthony hunting trips and fishing trips and excursions to Atlantic City , \" oh , some time soon now \" ; but none of them ever materialized .\nOne trip they did take ; when Anthony was eleven they went abroad , to England and Switzerland , and there in the best hotel in Lucerne his father died with much sweating and grunting and crying aloud for air .\nIn a panic of despair and terror Anthony was brought back to America , wedded to a vague melancholy that was to stay beside him through the rest of his life .\nPAST AND PERSON OF THE HERO At eleven he had a horror of death .\nWithin six impressionable years his parents had died and his grandmother had faded off almost imperceptibly , until , for the first time since her marriage , her person held for one day an unquestioned supremacy over her own drawing room .\nSo to Anthony life was a struggle against death , that waited at every corner .\nIt was as a concession to his hypochondriacal imagination that he formed the habit of reading in bed -- it soothed him .\nHe read until he was tired and often fell asleep with the lights still on .\nHis favorite diversion until he was fourteen was his stamp collection ; enormous , as nearly exhaustive as a boy 's could be -- his grandfather considered fatuously that it was teaching him geography .\nSo Anthony kept up a correspondence with a half dozen \" Stamp and Coin \" companies and it was rare that the mail failed to bring him new stamp-books or packages of glittering approval sheets -- there was a mysterious fascination in transferring his acquisitions interminably from one book to another .\nHis stamps were his greatest happiness and he bestowed impatient frowns on any one who interrupted him at play with them ; they devoured his allowance every month , and he lay awake at night musing untiringly on their variety and many-colored splendor .\nAt sixteen he had lived almost entirely within himself , an inarticulate boy , thoroughly un-American , and politely bewildered by his contemporaries .\nThe two preceding years had been spent in Europe with a private tutor , who persuaded him that Harvard was the thing ; it would \" open doors , \" it would be a tremendous tonic , it would give him innumerable self-sacrificing and devoted friends .\nSo he went to Harvard -- there was no other logical thing to be done with him .\nOblivious to the social system , he lived for a while alone and unsought in a high room in Beck Hall -- a slim dark boy of medium height with a shy sensitive mouth .\nHis allowance was more than liberal .\nHe laid the foundations for a library by purchasing from a wandering bibliophile first editions of Swinburne , Meredith , and Hardy , and a yellowed illegible autograph letter of Keats 's , finding later that he had been amazingly overcharged .\nHe became an exquisite dandy , amassed a rather pathetic collection of silk pajamas , brocaded dressing-gowns , and neckties too flamboyant to wear ; in this secret finery he would parade before a mirror in his room or lie stretched in satin along his window-seat looking down on the yard and realizing dimly this clamor , breathless and immediate , in which it seemed he was never to have a part .\nCuriously enough he found in senior year that he had acquired a position in his class .\nHe learned that he was looked upon as a rather romantic figure , a scholar , a recluse , a tower of erudition .\nThis amused him but secretly pleased him -- he began going out , at first a little and then a great deal .\nHe made the Pudding .\nHe drank -- quietly and in the proper tradition .\nIt was said of him that had he not come to college so young he might have \" done extremely well . \"\nIn 1909 , when he graduated , he was only twenty years old .\nThen abroad again -- to Rome this time , where he dallied with architecture and painting in turn , took up the violin , and wrote some ghastly Italian sonnets , supposedly the ruminations of a thirteenth-century monk on the joys of the contemplative life .\nIt became established among his Harvard intimates that he was in Rome , and those of them who were abroad that year looked him up and discovered with him , on many moonlight excursions , much in the city that was older than the Renaissance or indeed than the republic .\nMaury Noble , from Philadelphia , for instance , remained two months , and together they realized the peculiar charm of Latin women and had a delightful sense of being very young and free in a civilization that was very old and free .\nNot a few acquaintances of his grandfather 's called on him , and had he so desired he might have been _ persona grata _ with the diplomatic set -- indeed , he found that his inclinations tended more and more toward conviviality , but that long adolescent aloofness and consequent shyness still dictated to his conduct .\n",

    "CHAPTER I I ON a hill by the Mississippi where Chippewas camped two generations ago , a girl stood in relief against the cornflower blue of Northern sky .\nShe saw no Indians now ; she saw flour-mills and the blinking windows of skyscrapers in Minneapolis and St. Paul .\nNor was she thinking of squaws and portages , and the Yankee fur-traders whose shadows were all about her .\nShe was meditating upon walnut fudge , the plays of Brieux , the reasons why heels run over , and the fact that the chemistry instructor had stared at the new coiffure which concealed her ears .\nA breeze which had crossed a thousand miles of wheat-lands bellied her taffeta skirt in a line so graceful , so full of animation and moving beauty , that the heart of a chance watcher on the lower road tightened to wistfulness over her quality of suspended freedom .\nShe lifted her arms , she leaned back against the wind , her skirt dipped and flared , a lock blew wild .\nA girl on a hilltop ; credulous , plastic , young ; drinking the air as she longed to drink life .\nThe eternal aching comedy of expectant youth .\nIt is Carol Milford , fleeing for an hour from Blodgett College .\nThe days of pioneering , of lassies in sunbonnets , and bears killed with axes in piney clearings , are deader now than Camelot ; and a rebellious girl is the spirit of that bewildered empire called the American Middlewest .\nII Blodgett College is on the edge of Minneapolis .\nIt is a bulwark of sound religion .\nIt is still combating the recent heresies of Voltaire , Darwin , and Robert Ingersoll .\nPious families in Minnesota , Iowa , Wisconsin , the Dakotas send their children thither , and Blodgett protects them from the wickedness of the universities .\nBut it secretes friendly girls , young men who sing , and one lady instructress who really likes Milton and Carlyle .\nSo the four years which Carol spent at Blodgett were not altogether wasted .\nThe smallness of the school , the fewness of rivals , permitted her to experiment with her perilous versatility .\nShe played tennis , gave chafing-dish parties , took a graduate seminar in the drama , went “ twosing , ” and joined half a dozen societies for the practise of the arts or the tense stalking of a thing called General Culture .\nIn her class there were two or three prettier girls , but none more eager .\nShe was noticeable equally in the classroom grind and at dances , though out of the three hundred students of Blodgett , scores recited more accurately and dozens Bostoned more smoothly .\nEvery cell of her body was alive -- thin wrists , quince-blossom skin , ingenue eyes , black hair .\nThe other girls in her dormitory marveled at the slightness of her body when they saw her in sheer negligee , or darting out wet from a shower-bath .\nShe seemed then but half as large as they had supposed ; a fragile child who must be cloaked with understanding kindness .\n“ Psychic , ” the girls whispered , and “ spiritual . ”\nYet so radioactive were her nerves , so adventurous her trust in rather vaguely conceived sweetness and light , that she was more energetic than any of the hulking young women who , with calves bulging in heavy-ribbed woolen stockings beneath decorous blue serge bloomers , thuddingly galloped across the floor of the “ gym ” in practise for the Blodgett Ladies ’ Basket-Ball Team .\nEven when she was tired her dark eyes were observant .\nShe did not yet know the immense ability of the world to be casually cruel and proudly dull , but if she should ever learn those dismaying powers , her eyes would never become sullen or heavy or rheumily amorous .\nFor all her enthusiasms , for all the fondness and the “ crushes ” which she inspired , Carol ’s acquaintances were shy of her .\nWhen she was most ardently singing hymns or planning deviltry she yet seemed gently aloof and critical .\nShe was credulous , perhaps ; a born hero-worshipper ; yet she did question and examine unceasingly .\nWhatever she might become she would never be static .\nHer versatility ensnared her .\nBy turns she hoped to discover that she had an unusual voice , a talent for the piano , the ability to act , to write , to manage organizations .\nAlways she was disappointed , but always she effervesced anew -- over the Student Volunteers , who intended to become missionaries , over painting scenery for the dramatic club , over soliciting advertisements for the college magazine .\nShe was on the peak that Sunday afternoon when she played in chapel .\nOut of the dusk her violin took up the organ theme , and the candle-light revealed her in a straight golden frock , her arm arched to the bow , her lips serious .\nEvery man fell in love then with religion and Carol .\nThroughout Senior year she anxiously related all her experiments and partial successes to a career .\nDaily , on the library steps or in the hall of the Main Building , the co-eds talked of “ What shall we do when we finish college ? ”\nEven the girls who knew that they were going to be married pretended to be considering important business positions ; even they who knew that they would have to work hinted about fabulous suitors .\nAs for Carol , she was an orphan ; her only near relative was a vanilla-flavored sister married to an optician in St. Paul .\nShe had used most of the money from her father ’s estate .\nShe was not in love -- that is , not often , nor ever long at a time .\nShe would earn her living .\nBut how she was to earn it , how she was to conquer the world -- almost entirely for the world ’s own good -- she did not see .\nMost of the girls who were not betrothed meant to be teachers .\nOf these there were two sorts : careless young women who admitted that they intended to leave the “ beastly classroom and grubby children ” the minute they had a chance to marry ; and studious , sometimes bulbous-browed and pop-eyed maidens who at class prayer-meetings requested God to “ guide their feet along the paths of greatest usefulness . ”\nNeither sort tempted Carol .\nThe former seemed insincere ( a favorite word of hers at this era ) .\nThe earnest virgins were , she fancied , as likely to do harm as to do good by their faith in the value of parsing Caesar .\nAt various times during Senior year Carol finally decided upon studying law , writing motion-picture scenarios , professional nursing , and marrying an unidentified hero .\nThen she found a hobby in sociology .\nThe sociology instructor was new .\nHe was married , and therefore taboo , but he had come from Boston , he had lived among poets and socialists and Jews and millionaire uplifters at the University Settlement in New York , and he had a beautiful white strong neck .\nHe led a giggling class through the prisons , the charity bureaus , the employment agencies of Minneapolis and St. Paul .\nTrailing at the end of the line Carol was indignant at the prodding curiosity of the others , their manner of staring at the poor as at a Zoo .\nShe felt herself a great liberator .\nShe put her hand to her mouth , her forefinger and thumb quite painfully pinching her lower lip , and frowned , and enjoyed being aloof .\nA classmate named Stewart Snyder , a competent bulky young man in a gray flannel shirt , a rusty black bow tie , and the green-and-purple class cap , grumbled to her as they walked behind the others in the muck of the South St. Paul stockyards , “ These college chumps make me tired .\nThey ’re so top-lofty .\nThey ought to of worked on the farm , the way I have .\nThese workmen put it all over them . ”\n“ I just love common workmen , ” glowed Carol .\n“ Only you do n’t want to forget that common workmen do n’t think they ’re common ! ”\n“ You ’re right !\nI apologize ! ”\nCarol ’s brows lifted in the astonishment of emotion , in a glory of abasement .\nHer eyes mothered the world .\nStewart Snyder peered at her .\nHe rammed his large red fists into his pockets , he jerked them out , he resolutely got rid of them by clenching his hands behind him , and he stammered : “ I know .\nYou _ get _ people .\nMost of these darn co-eds ---- Say , Carol , you could do a lot for people . ”\n“ Oh -- oh well -- you know -- sympathy and everything -- if you were -- say you were a lawyer ’s wife .\nYou ’d understand his clients .\nI ’m going to be a lawyer .\nI admit I fall down in sympathy sometimes .\nI get so dog-gone impatient with people that ca n’t stand the gaff .\nYou ’d be good for a fellow that was too serious .\nMake him more -- more -- YOU know -- sympathetic ! ”\nHis slightly pouting lips , his mastiff eyes , were begging her to beg him to go on .\nShe fled from the steam-roller of his sentiment .\nShe cried , “ Oh , see those poor sheep -- millions and millions of them . ”\nShe darted on .\nStewart was not interesting .\nHe had n’t a shapely white neck , and he had never lived among celebrated reformers .\nShe wanted , just now , to have a cell in a settlement-house , like a nun without the bother of a black robe , and be kind , and read Bernard Shaw , and enormously improve a horde of grateful poor .\nThe supplementary reading in sociology led her to a book on village-improvement -- tree-planting , town pageants , girls ’ clubs .\nIt had pictures of greens and garden-walls in France , New England , Pennsylvania .\nShe had picked it up carelessly , with a slight yawn which she patted down with her finger-tips as delicately as a cat .\nShe dipped into the book , lounging on her window-seat , with her slim , lisle-stockinged legs crossed , and her knees up under her chin .\nShe stroked a satin pillow while she read .\nAbout her was the clothy exuberance of a Blodgett College room : cretonne-covered window-seat , photographs of girls , a carbon print of the Coliseum , a chafing-dish , and a dozen pillows embroidered or beaded or pyrographed .\nShockingly out of place was a miniature of the Dancing Bacchante .\nIt was the only trace of Carol in the room .\nShe had inherited the rest from generations of girl students .\nIt was as a part of all this commonplaceness that she regarded the treatise on village-improvement .\nBut she suddenly stopped fidgeting .\nShe strode into the book .\nShe had fled half-way through it before the three o’clock bell called her to the class in English history .\nShe sighed , “ That ’s what I ’ll do after college !\nI ’ll get my hands on one of these prairie towns and make it beautiful .\nBe an inspiration .\nI suppose I ’d better become a teacher then , but -- I wo n’t be that kind of a teacher .\nI wo n’t drone .\nWhy should they have all the garden suburbs on Long Island ?\nNobody has done anything with the ugly towns here in the Northwest except hold revivals and build libraries to contain the Elsie books .\nI ’ll make ‘ em put in a village green , and darling cottages , and a quaint Main Street ! ”\n",
