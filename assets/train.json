    "BOOK ONE -- The Romantic Egotist CHAPTER 1 .\nAmory , Son of Beatrice Amory Blaine inherited from his mother every trait , except the stray inexpressible few , that made him worth while .\nHis father , an ineffectual , inarticulate man with a taste for Byron and a habit of drowsing over the Encyclopedia Britannica , grew wealthy at thirty through the death of two elder brothers , successful Chicago brokers , and in the first flush of feeling that the world was his , went to Bar Harbor and met Beatrice O'Hara .\nIn consequence , Stephen Blaine handed down to posterity his height of just under six feet and his tendency to waver at crucial moments , these two abstractions appearing in his son Amory .\nFor many years he hovered in the background of his family 's life , an unassertive figure with a face half-obliterated by lifeless , silky hair , continually occupied in “ taking care ” of his wife , continually harassed by the idea that he did n't and could n't understand her .\nBut Beatrice Blaine !\nThere was a woman !\nEarly pictures taken on her father 's estate at Lake Geneva , Wisconsin , or in Rome at the Sacred Heart Convent -- an educational extravagance that in her youth was only for the daughters of the exceptionally wealthy -- showed the exquisite delicacy of her features , the consummate art and simplicity of her clothes .\nA brilliant education she had -- her youth passed in renaissance glory , she was versed in the latest gossip of the Older Roman Families ; known by name as a fabulously wealthy American girl to Cardinal Vitori and Queen Margherita and more subtle celebrities that one must have had some culture even to have heard of .\nShe learned in England to prefer whiskey and soda to wine , and her small talk was broadened in two senses during a winter in Vienna .\nAll in all Beatrice O'Hara absorbed the sort of education that will be quite impossible ever again ; a tutelage measured by the number of things and people one could be contemptuous of and charming about ; a culture rich in all arts and traditions , barren of all ideas , in the last of those days when the great gardener clipped the inferior roses to produce one perfect bud .\nIn her less important moments she returned to America , met Stephen Blaine and married him -- this almost entirely because she was a little bit weary , a little bit sad .\nHer only child was carried through a tiresome season and brought into the world on a spring day in ninety-six .\nWhen Amory was five he was already a delightful companion for her .\nHe was an auburn-haired boy , with great , handsome eyes which he would grow up to in time , a facile imaginative mind and a taste for fancy dress .\nFrom his fourth to his tenth year he did the country with his mother in her father 's private car , from Coronado , where his mother became so bored that she had a nervous breakdown in a fashionable hotel , down to Mexico City , where she took a mild , almost epidemic consumption .\nThis trouble pleased her , and later she made use of it as an intrinsic part of her atmosphere -- especially after several astounding bracers .\nSo , while more or less fortunate little rich boys were defying governesses on the beach at Newport , or being spanked or tutored or read to from “ Do and Dare , ” or “ Frank on the Mississippi , ” Amory was biting acquiescent bell-boys in the Waldorf , outgrowing a natural repugnance to chamber music and symphonies , and deriving a highly specialized education from his mother .\n“ Amory . ”\n“ Yes , Beatrice . ”\n( Such a quaint name for his mother ; she encouraged it . )\n“ Dear , do n't _ think _ of getting out of bed yet .\nI 've always suspected that early rising in early life makes one nervous .\nClothilde is having your breakfast brought up . ”\n“ All right . ”\n“ I am feeling very old to-day , Amory , ” she would sigh , her face a rare cameo of pathos , her voice exquisitely modulated , her hands as facile as Bernhardt 's .\n“ My nerves are on edge -- on edge .\nWe must leave this terrifying place to-morrow and go searching for sunshine . ”\nAmory 's penetrating green eyes would look out through tangled hair at his mother .\nEven at this age he had no illusions about her .\n“ Amory . ”\n“ Oh , _ yes _ . ”\n“ I want you to take a red-hot bath as hot as you can bear it , and just relax your nerves .\nYou can read in the tub if you wish . ”\nShe fed him sections of the “ Fetes Galantes ” before he was ten ; at eleven he could talk glibly , if rather reminiscently , of Brahms and Mozart and Beethoven .\nOne afternoon , when left alone in the hotel at Hot Springs , he sampled his mother 's apricot cordial , and as the taste pleased him , he became quite tipsy .\nThis was fun for a while , but he essayed a cigarette in his exaltation , and succumbed to a vulgar , plebeian reaction .\nThough this incident horrified Beatrice , it also secretly amused her and became part of what in a later generation would have been termed her “ line . ”\n“ This son of mine , ” he heard her tell a room full of awestruck , admiring women one day , “ is entirely sophisticated and quite charming -- but delicate -- we 're all delicate ; _ here _ , you know . ”\nHer hand was radiantly outlined against her beautiful bosom ; then sinking her voice to a whisper , she told them of the apricot cordial .\nThey rejoiced , for she was a brave raconteuse , but many were the keys turned in sideboard locks that night against the possible defection of little Bobby or Barbara ... .\nThese domestic pilgrimages were invariably in state ; two maids , the private car , or Mr. Blaine when available , and very often a physician .\nWhen Amory had the whooping-cough four disgusted specialists glared at each other hunched around his bed ; when he took scarlet fever the number of attendants , including physicians and nurses , totalled fourteen .\nHowever , blood being thicker than broth , he was pulled through .\nThe Blaines were attached to no city .\nThey were the Blaines of Lake Geneva ; they had quite enough relatives to serve in place of friends , and an enviable standing from Pasadena to Cape Cod .\nBut Beatrice grew more and more prone to like only new acquaintances , as there were certain stories , such as the history of her constitution and its many amendments , memories of her years abroad , that it was necessary for her to repeat at regular intervals .\nLike Freudian dreams , they must be thrown off , else they would sweep in and lay siege to her nerves .\nBut Beatrice was critical about American women , especially the floating population of ex-Westerners .\n“ They have accents , my dear , ” she told Amory , “ not Southern accents or Boston accents , not an accent attached to any locality , just an accent ” -- she became dreamy .\n“ They pick up old , moth-eaten London accents that are down on their luck and have to be used by some one .\nThey talk as an English butler might after several years in a Chicago grand-opera company . ”\nShe became almost incoherent -- “ Suppose -- time in every Western woman 's life -- she feels her husband is prosperous enough for her to have -- accent -- they try to impress _ me _ , my dear -- ” Though she thought of her body as a mass of frailties , she considered her soul quite as ill , and therefore important in her life .\nShe had once been a Catholic , but discovering that priests were infinitely more attentive when she was in process of losing or regaining faith in Mother Church , she maintained an enchantingly wavering attitude .\nOften she deplored the bourgeois quality of the American Catholic clergy , and was quite sure that had she lived in the shadow of the great Continental cathedrals her soul would still be a thin flame on the mighty altar of Rome .\nStill , next to doctors , priests were her favorite sport .\n“ Ah , Bishop Wiston , ” she would declare , “ I do not want to talk of myself .\nI can imagine the stream of hysterical women fluttering at your doors , beseeching you to be simpatico ” -- then after an interlude filled by the clergyman -- “ but my mood -- is -- oddly dissimilar . ”\nOnly to bishops and above did she divulge her clerical romance .\nWhen she had first returned to her country there had been a pagan , Swinburnian young man in Asheville , for whose passionate kisses and unsentimental conversations she had taken a decided penchant -- they had discussed the matter pro and con with an intellectual romancing quite devoid of sappiness .\nEventually she had decided to marry for background , and the young pagan from Asheville had gone through a spiritual crisis , joined the Catholic Church , and was now -- Monsignor Darcy .\n“ Indeed , Mrs. Blaine , he is still delightful company -- quite the cardinal 's right-hand man . ”\n“ Amory will go to him one day , I know , ” breathed the beautiful lady , “ and Monsignor Darcy will understand him as he understood me . ”\nAmory became thirteen , rather tall and slender , and more than ever on to his Celtic mother .\nHe had tutored occasionally -- the idea being that he was to “ keep up , ” at each place “ taking up the work where he left off , ” yet as no tutor ever found the place he left off , his mind was still in very good shape .\nWhat a few more years of this life would have made of him is problematical .\nHowever , four hours out from land , Italy bound , with Beatrice , his appendix burst , probably from too many meals in bed , and after a series of frantic telegrams to Europe and America , to the amazement of the passengers the great ship slowly wheeled around and returned to New York to deposit Amory at the pier .\nYou will admit that if it was not life it was magnificent .\nAfter the operation Beatrice had a nervous breakdown that bore a suspicious resemblance to delirium tremens , and Amory was left in Minneapolis , destined to spend the ensuing two years with his aunt and uncle .\nThere the crude , vulgar air of Western civilization first catches him -- in his underwear , so to speak .\n***** A KISS FOR AMORY His lip curled when he read it .\n“ I am going to have a bobbing party , ” it said , “ on Thursday , December the seventeenth , at five o'clock , and I would like it very much if you could come .\nYours truly ,\n",

    "CHAPTER I — START IN LIFE I was born in the year 1632 , in the city of York , of a good family , though not of that country , my father being a foreigner of Bremen , who settled first at Hull .\nHe got a good estate by merchandise , and leaving off his trade , lived afterwards at York , from whence he had married my mother , whose relations were named Robinson , a very good family in that country , and from whom I was called Robinson Kreutznaer ; but , by the usual corruption of words in England , we are now called — nay we call ourselves and write our name — Crusoe ; and so my companions always called me .\nI had two elder brothers , one of whom was lieutenant-colonel to an English regiment of foot in Flanders , formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart , and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the Spaniards .\nWhat became of my second brother I never knew , any more than my father or mother knew what became of me .\nBeing the third son of the family and not bred to any trade , my head began to be filled very early with rambling thoughts .\nMy father , who was very ancient , had given me a competent share of learning , as far as house-education and a country free school generally go , and designed me for the law ; but I would be satisfied with nothing but going to sea ; and my inclination to this led me so strongly against the will , nay , the commands of my father , and against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and other friends , that there seemed to be something fatal in that propensity of nature , tending directly to the life of misery which was to befall me .\nMy father , a wise and grave man , gave me serious and excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design .\nHe called me one morning into his chamber , where he was confined by the gout , and expostulated very warmly with me upon this subject .\nHe asked me what reasons , more than a mere wandering inclination , I had for leaving father ’s house and my native country , where I might be well introduced , and had a prospect of raising my fortune by application and industry , with a life of ease and pleasure .\nHe told me it was men of desperate fortunes on one hand , or of aspiring , superior fortunes on the other , who went abroad upon adventures , to rise by enterprise , and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature out of the common road ; that these things were all either too far above me or too far below me ; that mine was the middle state , or what might be called the upper station of low life , which he had found , by long experience , was the best state in the world , the most suited to human happiness , not exposed to the miseries and hardships , the labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind , and not embarrassed with the pride , luxury , ambition , and envy of the upper part of mankind .\nHe told me I might judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing — viz .\nthat this was the state of life which all other people envied ; that kings have frequently lamented the miserable consequence of being born to great things , and wished they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes , between the mean and the great ; that the wise man gave his testimony to this , as the standard of felicity , when he prayed to have neither poverty nor riches .\nHe bade me observe it , and I should always find that the calamities of life were shared among the upper and lower part of mankind , but that the middle station had the fewest disasters , and was not exposed to so many vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind ; nay , they were not subjected to so many distempers and uneasinesses , either of body or mind , as those were who , by vicious living , luxury , and extravagances on the one hand , or by hard labour , want of necessaries , and mean or insufficient diet on the other hand , bring distemper upon themselves by the natural consequences of their way of living ; that the middle station of life was calculated for all kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments ; that peace and plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune ; that temperance , moderation , quietness , health , society , all agreeable diversions , and all desirable pleasures , were the blessings attending the middle station of life ; that this way men went silently and smoothly through the world , and comfortably out of it , not embarrassed with the labours of the hands or of the head , not sold to a life of slavery for daily bread , nor harassed with perplexed circumstances , which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest , nor enraged with the passion of envy , or the secret burning lust of ambition for great things ; but , in easy circumstances , sliding gently through the world , and sensibly tasting the sweets of living , without the bitter ; feeling that they are happy , and learning by every day ’s experience to know it more sensibly .\nAfter this he pressed me earnestly , and in the most affectionate manner , not to play the young man , nor to precipitate myself into miseries which nature , and the station of life I was born in , seemed to have provided against ; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread ; that he would do well for me , and endeavour to enter me fairly into the station of life which he had just been recommending to me ; and that if I was not very easy and happy in the world , it must be my mere fate or fault that must hinder it ; and that he should have nothing to answer for , having thus discharged his duty in warning me against measures which he knew would be to my hurt ; in a word , that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay and settle at home as he directed , so he would not have so much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any encouragement to go away ; and to close all , he told me I had my elder brother for an example , to whom he had used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going into the Low Country wars , but could not prevail , his young desires prompting him to run into the army , where he was killed ; and though he said he would not cease to pray for me , yet he would venture to say to me , that if I did take this foolish step , God would not bless me , and I should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist in my recovery .\nI observed in this last part of his discourse , which was truly prophetic , though I suppose my father did not know it to be so himself — I say , I observed the tears run down his face very plentifully , especially when he spoke of my brother who was killed : and that when he spoke of my having leisure to repent , and none to assist me , he was so moved that he broke off the discourse , and told me his heart was so full he could say no more to me .\nI was sincerely affected with this discourse , and , indeed , who could be otherwise ?\nand I resolved not to think of going abroad any more , but to settle at home according to my father ’s desire .\nBut alas !\na few days wore it all off ; and , in short , to prevent any of my father ’s further importunities , in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite away from him .\nHowever , I did not act quite so hastily as the first heat of my resolution prompted ; but I took my mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant than ordinary , and told her that my thoughts were so entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never settle to anything with resolution enough to go through with it , and my father had better give me his consent than force me to go without it ; that I was now eighteen years old , which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk to an attorney ; that I was sure if I did I should never serve out my time , but I should certainly run away from my master before my time was out , and go to sea ; and if she would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad , if I came home again , and did not like it , I would go no more ; and I would promise , by a double diligence , to recover the time that I had lost .\nThis put my mother into a great passion ; she told me she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father upon any such subject ; that he knew too well what was my interest to give his consent to anything so much for my hurt ; and that she wondered how I could think of any such thing after the discourse I had had with my father , and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my father had used to me ; and that , in short , if I would ruin myself , there was no help for me ; but I might depend I should never have their consent to it ; that for her part she would not have so much hand in my destruction ; and I should never have it to say that my mother was willing when my father was not .\nThough my mother refused to move it to my father , yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to him , and that my father , after showing a great concern at it , said to her , with a sigh , “ That boy might be happy if he would stay at home ; but if he goes abroad , he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born : I can give no consent to it . ”\nIt was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose , though , in the meantime , I continued obstinately deaf to all proposals of settling to business , and frequently expostulated with my father and mother about their being so positively determined against what they knew my inclinations prompted me to .\nBut being one day at Hull , where I went casually , and without any purpose of making an elopement at that time ; but , I say , being there , and one of my companions being about to sail to London in his father ’s ship , and prompting me to go with them with the common allurement of seafaring men , that it should cost me nothing for my passage , I consulted neither father nor mother any more , nor so much as sent them word of it ; but leaving them to hear of it as they might , without asking God ’s blessing or my father ’s , without any consideration of circumstances or consequences , and in an ill hour , God knows , on the 1st of September 1651 , I went on board a ship bound for London .\nNever any young adventurer ’s misfortunes , I believe , began sooner , or continued longer than mine .\nThe ship was no sooner out of the Humber than the wind began to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner ; and , as I had never been at sea before , I was most inexpressibly sick in body and terrified in mind .\nI began now seriously to reflect upon what I had done , and how justly I was overtaken by the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my father ’s house , and abandoning my duty .\nAll the good counsels of my parents , my father ’s tears and my mother ’s entreaties , came now fresh into my mind ; and my conscience , which was not yet come to the pitch of hardness to which it has since , reproached me with the contempt of advice , and the breach of my duty to God and my father .\n",

    "CHAPTER I It was a Sunday evening in October , and in common with many other young ladies of her class , Katharine Hilbery was pouring out tea .\nPerhaps a fifth part of her mind was thus occupied , and the remaining parts leapt over the little barrier of day which interposed between Monday morning and this rather subdued moment , and played with the things one does voluntarily and normally in the daylight .\nBut although she was silent , she was evidently mistress of a situation which was familiar enough to her , and inclined to let it take its way for the six hundredth time , perhaps , without bringing into play any of her unoccupied faculties .\nA single glance was enough to show that Mrs. Hilbery was so rich in the gifts which make tea-parties of elderly distinguished people successful , that she scarcely needed any help from her daughter , provided that the tiresome business of teacups and bread and butter was discharged for her .\nConsidering that the little party had been seated round the tea-table for less than twenty minutes , the animation observable on their faces , and the amount of sound they were producing collectively , were very creditable to the hostess .\nIt suddenly came into Katharine ’s mind that if some one opened the door at this moment he would think that they were enjoying themselves ; he would think , “ What an extremely nice house to come into ! ”\nand instinctively she laughed , and said something to increase the noise , for the credit of the house presumably , since she herself had not been feeling exhilarated .\nAt the very same moment , rather to her amusement , the door was flung open , and a young man entered the room .\nKatharine , as she shook hands with him , asked him , in her own mind , “ Now , do you think we ’re enjoying ourselves enormously ? ”\n... “ Mr. Denham , mother , ” she said aloud , for she saw that her mother had forgotten his name .\nThat fact was perceptible to Mr. Denham also , and increased the awkwardness which inevitably attends the entrance of a stranger into a room full of people much at their ease , and all launched upon sentences .\nAt the same time , it seemed to Mr. Denham as if a thousand softly padded doors had closed between him and the street outside .\nA fine mist , the etherealized essence of the fog , hung visibly in the wide and rather empty space of the drawing-room , all silver where the candles were grouped on the tea-table , and ruddy again in the firelight .\nWith the omnibuses and cabs still running in his head , and his body still tingling with his quick walk along the streets and in and out of traffic and foot-passengers , this drawing-room seemed very remote and still ; and the faces of the elderly people were mellowed , at some distance from each other , and had a bloom on them owing to the fact that the air in the drawing-room was thickened by blue grains of mist .\nMr. Denham had come in as Mr. Fortescue , the eminent novelist , reached the middle of a very long sentence .\nHe kept this suspended while the newcomer sat down , and Mrs. Hilbery deftly joined the severed parts by leaning towards him and remarking : “ Now , what would you do if you were married to an engineer , and had to live in Manchester , Mr. Denham ? ”\n“ Surely she could learn Persian , ” broke in a thin , elderly gentleman .\n“ Is there no retired schoolmaster or man of letters in Manchester with whom she could read Persian ? ”\n“ A cousin of ours has married and gone to live in Manchester , ” Katharine explained .\nMr. Denham muttered something , which was indeed all that was required of him , and the novelist went on where he had left off .\nPrivately , Mr. Denham cursed himself very sharply for having exchanged the freedom of the street for this sophisticated drawing-room , where , among other disagreeables , he certainly would not appear at his best .\nHe glanced round him , and saw that , save for Katharine , they were all over forty , the only consolation being that Mr. Fortescue was a considerable celebrity , so that to-morrow one might be glad to have met him .\n“ Have you ever been to Manchester ? ”\nhe asked Katharine .\n“ Never , ” she replied .\n“ Why do you object to it , then ? ”\nKatharine stirred her tea , and seemed to speculate , so Denham thought , upon the duty of filling somebody else ’s cup , but she was really wondering how she was going to keep this strange young man in harmony with the rest .\nShe observed that he was compressing his teacup , so that there was danger lest the thin china might cave inwards .\nShe could see that he was nervous ; one would expect a bony young man with his face slightly reddened by the wind , and his hair not altogether smooth , to be nervous in such a party .\nFurther , he probably disliked this kind of thing , and had come out of curiosity , or because her father had invited him -- anyhow , he would not be easily combined with the rest .\n“ I should think there would be no one to talk to in Manchester , ” she replied at random .\nMr. Fortescue had been observing her for a moment or two , as novelists are inclined to observe , and at this remark he smiled , and made it the text for a little further speculation .\n“ In spite of a slight tendency to exaggeration , Katharine decidedly hits the mark , ” he said , and lying back in his chair , with his opaque contemplative eyes fixed on the ceiling , and the tips of his fingers pressed together , he depicted , first the horrors of the streets of Manchester , and then the bare , immense moors on the outskirts of the town , and then the scrubby little house in which the girl would live , and then the professors and the miserable young students devoted to the more strenuous works of our younger dramatists , who would visit her , and how her appearance would change by degrees , and how she would fly to London , and how Katharine would have to lead her about , as one leads an eager dog on a chain , past rows of clamorous butchers ’ shops , poor dear creature .\n“ Oh , Mr. Fortescue , ” exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery , as he finished , “ I had just written to say how I envied her !\nI was thinking of the big gardens and the dear old ladies in mittens , who read nothing but the “ Spectator , ” and snuff the candles .\nHave they ALL disappeared ?\nI told her she would find the nice things of London without the horrid streets that depress one so . ”\n“ There is the University , ” said the thin gentleman , who had previously insisted upon the existence of people knowing Persian .\n“ I know there are moors there , because I read about them in a book the other day , ” said Katharine .\n“ I am grieved and amazed at the ignorance of my family , ” Mr. Hilbery remarked .\nHe was an elderly man , with a pair of oval , hazel eyes which were rather bright for his time of life , and relieved the heaviness of his face .\nHe played constantly with a little green stone attached to his watch-chain , thus displaying long and very sensitive fingers , and had a habit of moving his head hither and thither very quickly without altering the position of his large and rather corpulent body , so that he seemed to be providing himself incessantly with food for amusement and reflection with the least possible expenditure of energy .\nOne might suppose that he had passed the time of life when his ambitions were personal , or that he had gratified them as far as he was likely to do , and now employed his considerable acuteness rather to observe and reflect than to attain any result .\nKatharine , so Denham decided , while Mr. Fortescue built up another rounded structure of words , had a likeness to each of her parents , but these elements were rather oddly blended .\nShe had the quick , impulsive movements of her mother , the lips parting often to speak , and closing again ; and the dark oval eyes of her father brimming with light upon a basis of sadness , or , since she was too young to have acquired a sorrowful point of view , one might say that the basis was not sadness so much as a spirit given to contemplation and self-control .\nJudging by her hair , her coloring , and the shape of her features , she was striking , if not actually beautiful .\nDecision and composure stamped her , a combination of qualities that produced a very marked character , and one that was not calculated to put a young man , who scarcely knew her , at his ease .\nFor the rest , she was tall ; her dress was of some quiet color , with old yellow-tinted lace for ornament , to which the spark of an ancient jewel gave its one red gleam .\nDenham noticed that , although silent , she kept sufficient control of the situation to answer immediately her mother appealed to her for help , and yet it was obvious to him that she attended only with the surface skin of her mind .\nIt struck him that her position at the tea-table , among all these elderly people , was not without its difficulties , and he checked his inclination to find her , or her attitude , generally antipathetic to him .\nThe talk had passed over Manchester , after dealing with it very generously .\n“ Would it be the Battle of Trafalgar or the Spanish Armada , Katharine ? ”\nher mother demanded .\n“ Trafalgar , mother . ”\n“ Trafalgar , of course !\nHow stupid of me !\nAnother cup of tea , with a thin slice of lemon in it , and then , dear Mr. Fortescue , please explain my absurd little puzzle .\nOne ca n’t help believing gentlemen with Roman noses , even if one meets them in omnibuses . ”\nMr. Hilbery here interposed so far as Denham was concerned , and talked a great deal of sense about the solicitors ’ profession , and the changes which he had seen in his lifetime .\nIndeed , Denham properly fell to his lot , owing to the fact that an article by Denham upon some legal matter , published by Mr. Hilbery in his Review , had brought them acquainted .\nBut when a moment later Mrs. Sutton Bailey was announced , he turned to her , and Mr. Denham found himself sitting silent , rejecting possible things to say , beside Katharine , who was silent too .\nBeing much about the same age and both under thirty , they were prohibited from the use of a great many convenient phrases which launch conversation into smooth waters .\nThey were further silenced by Katharine ’s rather malicious determination not to help this young man , in whose upright and resolute bearing she detected something hostile to her surroundings , by any of the usual feminine amenities .\nThey therefore sat silent , Denham controlling his desire to say something abrupt and explosive , which should shock her into life .\nBut Mrs. Hilbery was immediately sensitive to any silence in the drawing-room , as of a dumb note in a sonorous scale , and leaning across the table she observed , in the curiously tentative detached manner which always gave her phrases the likeness of butterflies flaunting from one sunny spot to another , “ D’you know , Mr. Denham , you remind me so much of dear Mr. Ruskin ... .\nIs it his tie , Katharine , or his hair , or the way he sits in his chair ?\nDo tell me , Mr. Denham , are you an admirer of Ruskin ?\nSome one , the other day , said to me , ‘ Oh , no , we do n’t read Ruskin , Mrs. Hilbery . ’\nWhat DO you read , I wonder ?\n-- for you ca n’t spend all your time going up in aeroplanes and burrowing into the bowels of the earth . ”\n",

    "CHAPTER I “ TOM ! ”\nNo answer .\n“ TOM ! ”\nNo answer .\n“ What 's gone with that boy , I wonder ?\nYou TOM ! ”\nNo answer .\nThe old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room ; then she put them up and looked out under them .\nShe seldom or never looked _ through _ them for so small a thing as a boy ; they were her state pair , the pride of her heart , and were built for “ style , ” not service -- she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well .\nShe looked perplexed for a moment , and then said , not fiercely , but still loud enough for the furniture to hear : “ Well , I lay if I get hold of you I 'll -- ” She did not finish , for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom , and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with .\nShe resurrected nothing but the cat .\n“ I never did see the beat of that boy ! ”\nShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and “ jimpson ” weeds that constituted the garden .\nNo Tom .\nSo she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted : “ Y-o-u-u TOM ! ”\nThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight .\n“ There !\nI might ' a ' thought of that closet .\nWhat you been doing in there ? ”\n“ Nothing . ”\n“ Nothing !\nLook at your hands .\nAnd look at your mouth .\nWhat _ is _ that truck ? ”\n“ I do n't know , aunt . ”\n“ Well , I know .\nIt 's jam -- that 's what it is .\nForty times I 've said if you did n't let that jam alone I 'd skin you .\nHand me that switch . ”\nThe switch hovered in the air -- the peril was desperate -- “ My !\nLook behind you , aunt ! ”\nThe old lady whirled round , and snatched her skirts out of danger .\nThe lad fled on the instant , scrambled up the high board-fence , and disappeared over it .\nHis aunt Polly stood surprised a moment , and then broke into a gentle laugh .\n“ Hang the boy , ca n't I never learn anything ?\nAi n't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time ?\nBut old fools is the biggest fools there is .\nCa n't learn an old dog new tricks , as the saying is .\nBut my goodness , he never plays them alike , two days , and how is a body to know what 's coming ?\nHe ' pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up , and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh , it 's all down again and I ca n't hit him a lick .\nI ai n't doing my duty by that boy , and that 's the Lord 's truth , goodness knows .\nSpare the rod and spile the child , as the Good Book says .\nI 'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both , I know .\nHe 's full of the Old Scratch , but laws-a-me !\nhe 's my own dead sister 's boy , poor thing , and I ai n't got the heart to lash him , somehow .\nEvery time I let him off , my conscience does hurt me so , and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks .\nWell-a-well , man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble , as the Scripture says , and I reckon it 's so .\nHe 'll play hookey this evening , * and [ * Southwestern for “ afternoon ” ] I 'll just be obleeged to make him work , tomorrow , to punish him .\nIt 's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays , when all the boys is having holiday , but he hates work more than he hates anything else , and I 've _ got _ to do some of my duty by him , or I 'll be the ruination of the child . ”\nTom did play hookey , and he had a very good time .\nHe got back home barely in season to help Jim , the small colored boy , saw next-day 's wood and split the kindlings before supper -- at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work .\nTom 's younger brother ( or rather half-brother ) Sid was already through with his part of the work ( picking up chips ) , for he was a quiet boy , and had no adventurous , trouble-some ways .\nWhile Tom was eating his supper , and stealing sugar as opportunity offered , Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile , and very deep -- for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments .\nLike many other simple-hearted souls , it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy , and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning .\nSaid she : “ Tom , it was middling warm in school , war n't it ? ”\n“ Yes 'm . ”\n“ Powerful warm , war n't it ? ”\n“ Yes 'm . ”\n“ Did n't you want to go in a-swimming , Tom ? ”\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom -- a touch of uncomfortable suspicion .\nHe searched Aunt Polly 's face , but it told him nothing .\nSo he said : “ No 'm -- well , not very much . ”\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom 's shirt , and said : “ But you ai n't too warm now , though . ”\nAnd it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind .\nBut in spite of her , Tom knew where the wind lay , now .\nSo he forestalled what might be the next move : “ Some of us pumped on our heads -- mine 's damp yet .\nSee ? ”\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence , and missed a trick .\nThen she had a new inspiration : “ Tom , you did n't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it , to pump on your head , did you ?\nUnbutton your jacket ! ”\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom 's face .\nHe opened his jacket .\nHis shirt collar was securely sewed .\n“ Bother !\nWell , go ' long with you .\nI 'd made sure you 'd played hookey and been a-swimming .\nBut I forgive ye , Tom .\nI reckon you 're a kind of a singed cat , as the saying is -- better 'n you look .\n_ This _ time . ”\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried , and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once .\nBut Sidney said : “ Well , now , if I did n't think you sewed his collar with white thread , but it 's black . ”\n“ Why , I did sew it with white !\nTom ! ”\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest .\nAs he went out at the door he said : “ Siddy , I 'll lick you for that . ”\nIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket , and had thread bound about them -- one needle carried white thread and the other black .\nHe said : “ She 'd never noticed if it had n't been for Sid .\nConfound it !\nsometimes she sews it with white , and sometimes she sews it with black .\nI wish to gee-miny she 'd stick to one or t ' other -- I ca n't keep the run of 'em .\nBut I bet you I 'll lam Sid for that .\nI 'll learn him ! ”\nHe was not the Model Boy of the village .\nHe knew the model boy very well though -- and loathed him .\nWithin two minutes , or even less , he had forgotten all his troubles .\nNot because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man 's are to a man , but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time -- just as men 's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises .\nThis new interest was a valued novelty in whistling , which he had just acquired from a negro , and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed .\nIt consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn , a sort of liquid warble , produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music -- the reader probably remembers how to do it , if he has ever been a boy .\nDiligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it , and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude .\nHe felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet -- no doubt , as far as strong , deep , unalloyed pleasure is concerned , the advantage was with the boy , not the astronomer .\nThe summer evenings were long .\nIt was not dark , yet .\nPresently Tom checked his whistle .\nA stranger was before him -- a boy a shade larger than himself .\nA new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg .\nThis boy was well dressed , too -- well dressed on a week-day .\nThis was simply as astounding .\nHis cap was a dainty thing , his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty , and so were his pantaloons .\nHe had shoes on -- and it was only Friday .\nHe even wore a necktie , a bright bit of ribbon .\nHe had a citified air about him that ate into Tom 's vitals .\nThe more Tom stared at the splendid marvel , the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow .\nNeither boy spoke .\nIf one moved , the other moved -- but only sidewise , in a circle ; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time .\nFinally Tom said : “ I can lick you ! ”\n“ I 'd like to see you try it . ”\n“ Well , I can do it . ”\n",

    "PART I .\nA VOYAGE TO LILLIPUT .\nCHAPTER I .\nThe author gives some account of himself and family .\nHis first inducements to travel .\nHe is shipwrecked , and swims for his life .\nGets safe on shore in the country of Lilliput ; is made a prisoner , and carried up the country .\nMy father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire : I was the third of five sons .\nHe sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old , where I resided three years , and applied myself close to my studies ; but the charge of maintaining me , although I had a very scanty allowance , being too great for a narrow fortune , I was bound apprentice to Mr. James Bates , an eminent surgeon in London , with whom I continued four years .\nMy father now and then sending me small sums of money , I laid them out in learning navigation , and other parts of the mathematics , useful to those who intend to travel , as I always believed it would be , some time or other , my fortune to do .\nWhen I left Mr. Bates , I went down to my father : where , by the assistance of him and my uncle John , and some other relations , I got forty pounds , and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me at Leyden : there I studied physic two years and seven months , knowing it would be useful in long voyages .\nSoon after my return from Leyden , I was recommended by my good master , Mr. Bates , to be surgeon to the Swallow , Captain Abraham Pannel , commander ; with whom I continued three years and a half , making a voyage or two into the Levant , and some other parts .\nWhen I came back I resolved to settle in London ; to which Mr. Bates , my master , encouraged me , and by him I was recommended to several patients .\nI took part of a small house in the Old Jewry ; and being advised to alter my condition , I married Mrs. Mary Burton , second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton , hosier , in Newgate-street , with whom I received four hundred pounds for a portion .\nBut my good master Bates dying in two years after , and I having few friends , my business began to fail ; for my conscience would not suffer me to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren .\nHaving therefore consulted with my wife , and some of my acquaintance , I determined to go again to sea .\nI was surgeon successively in two ships , and made several voyages , for six years , to the East and West Indies , by which I got some addition to my fortune .\nMy hours of leisure I spent in reading the best authors , ancient and modern , being always provided with a good number of books ; and when I was ashore , in observing the manners and dispositions of the people , as well as learning their language ; wherein I had a great facility , by the strength of my memory .\nThe last of these voyages not proving very fortunate , I grew weary of the sea , and intended to stay at home with my wife and family .\nI removed from the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane , and from thence to Wapping , hoping to get business among the sailors ; but it would not turn to account .\nAfter three years expectation that things would mend , I accepted an advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard , master of the Antelope , who was making a voyage to the South Sea .\nWe set sail from Bristol , May 4 , 1699 , and our voyage was at first very prosperous .\nIt would not be proper , for some reasons , to trouble the reader with the particulars of our adventures in those seas ; let it suffice to inform him , that in our passage from thence to the East Indies , we were driven by a violent storm to the north-west of Van Diemen ’s Land .\nBy an observation , we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes south .\nTwelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labour and ill food ; the rest were in a very weak condition .\nOn the 5th of November , which was the beginning of summer in those parts , the weather being very hazy , the seamen spied a rock within half a cable ’s length of the ship ; but the wind was so strong , that we were driven directly upon it , and immediately split .\nSix of the crew , of whom I was one , having let down the boat into the sea , made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock .\nWe rowed , by my computation , about three leagues , till we were able to work no longer , being already spent with labour while we were in the ship .\nWe therefore trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves , and in about half an hour the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north .\nWhat became of my companions in the boat , as well as of those who escaped on the rock , or were left in the vessel , I can not tell ; but conclude they were all lost .\nFor my own part , I swam as fortune directed me , and was pushed forward by wind and tide .\nI often let my legs drop , and could feel no bottom ; but when I was almost gone , and able to struggle no longer , I found myself within my depth ; and by this time the storm was much abated .\nThe declivity was so small , that I walked near a mile before I got to the shore , which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in the evening .\nI then advanced forward near half a mile , but could not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants ; at least I was in so weak a condition , that I did not observe them .\nI was extremely tired , and with that , and the heat of the weather , and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship , I found myself much inclined to sleep .\nI lay down on the grass , which was very short and soft , where I slept sounder than ever I remembered to have done in my life , and , as I reckoned , about nine hours ; for when I awaked , it was just day-light .\nI attempted to rise , but was not able to stir : for , as I happened to lie on my back , I found my arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground ; and my hair , which was long and thick , tied down in the same manner .\nI likewise felt several slender ligatures across my body , from my arm-pits to my thighs .\nI could only look upwards ; the sun began to grow hot , and the light offended my eyes .\nI heard a confused noise about me ; but in the posture I lay , could see nothing except the sky .\nIn a little time I felt something alive moving on my left leg , which advancing gently forward over my breast , came almost up to my chin ; when , bending my eyes downwards as much as I could , I perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high , with a bow and arrow in his hands , and a quiver at his back .\nIn the mean time , I felt at least forty more of the same kind ( as I conjectured ) following the first .\nI was in the utmost astonishment , and roared so loud , that they all ran back in a fright ; and some of them , as I was afterwards told , were hurt with the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground .\nHowever , they soon returned , and one of them , who ventured so far as to get a full sight of my face , lifting up his hands and eyes by way of admiration , cried out in a shrill but distinct voice , _ Hekinah degul _ : the others repeated the same words several times , but then I knew not what they meant .\nI lay all this while , as the reader may believe , in great uneasiness .\nAt length , struggling to get loose , I had the fortune to break the strings , and wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground ; for , by lifting it up to my face , I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me , and at the same time with a violent pull , which gave me excessive pain , I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side , so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches .\nBut the creatures ran off a second time , before I could seize them ; whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent , and after it ceased I heard one of them cry aloud _ Tolgo phonac _ ; when in an instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand , which , pricked me like so many needles ; and besides , they shot another flight into the air , as we do bombs in Europe , whereof many , I suppose , fell on my body , ( though I felt them not ) , and some on my face , which I immediately covered with my left hand .\nWhen this shower of arrows was over , I fell a groaning with grief and pain ; and then striving again to get loose , they discharged another volley larger than the first , and some of them attempted with spears to stick me in the sides ; but by good luck I had on a buff jerkin , which they could not pierce .\nI thought it the most prudent method to lie still , and my design was to continue so till night , when , my left hand being already loose , I could easily free myself : and as for the inhabitants , I had reason to believe I might be a match for the greatest army they could bring against me , if they were all of the same size with him that I saw .\nBut fortune disposed otherwise of me .\nWhen the people observed I was quiet , they discharged no more arrows ; but , by the noise I heard , I knew their numbers increased ; and about four yards from me , over against my right ear , I heard a knocking for above an hour , like that of people at work ; when turning my head that way , as well as the pegs and strings would permit me , I saw a stage erected about a foot and a half from the ground , capable of holding four of the inhabitants , with two or three ladders to mount it : from whence one of them , who seemed to be a person of quality , made me a long speech , whereof I understood not one syllable .\nBut I should have mentioned , that before the principal person began his oration , he cried out three times , _ Langro dehul san _ ( these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained to me ) ; whereupon , immediately , about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head , which gave me the liberty of turning it to the right , and of observing the person and gesture of him that was to speak .\nHe appeared to be of a middle age , and taller than any of the other three who attended him , whereof one was a page that held up his train , and seemed to be somewhat longer than my middle finger ; the other two stood one on each side to support him .\nHe acted every part of an orator , and I could observe many periods of threatenings , and others of promises , pity , and kindness .\nI answered in a few words , but in the most submissive manner , lifting up my left hand , and both my eyes to the sun , as calling him for a witness ; and being almost famished with hunger , having not eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship , I found the demands of nature so strong upon me , that I could not forbear showing my impatience ( perhaps against the strict rules of decency ) by putting my finger frequently to my mouth , to signify that I wanted food .\nThe _ hurgo _ ( for so they call a great lord , as I afterwards learnt ) understood me very well .\nHe descended from the stage , and commanded that several ladders should be applied to my sides , on which above a hundred of the inhabitants mounted and walked towards my mouth , laden with baskets full of meat , which had been provided and sent thither by the king ’s orders , upon the first intelligence he received of me .\nI observed there was the flesh of several animals , but could not distinguish them by the taste .\nThere were shoulders , legs , and loins , shaped like those of mutton , and very well dressed , but smaller than the wings of a lark .\nI ate them by two or three at a mouthful , and took three loaves at a time , about the bigness of musket bullets .\nThey supplied me as fast as they could , showing a thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite .\nI then made another sign , that I wanted drink .\nThey found by my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me ; and being a most ingenious people , they slung up , with great dexterity , one of their largest hogsheads , then rolled it towards my hand , and beat out the top ; I drank it off at a draught , which I might well do , for it did not hold half a pint , and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy , but much more delicious .\nThey brought me a second hogshead , which I drank in the same manner , and made signs for more ; but they had none to give me .\nWhen I had performed these wonders , they shouted for joy , and danced upon my breast , repeating several times as they did at first , _ Hekinah degul _ .\nThey made me a sign that I should throw down the two hogsheads , but first warning the people below to stand out of the way , crying aloud , _ Borach mevolah _ ; and when they saw the vessels in the air , there was a universal shout of _ Hekinah degul _ .\nI confess I was often tempted , while they were passing backwards and forwards on my body , to seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach , and dash them against the ground .\nBut the remembrance of what I had felt , which probably might not be the worst they could do , and the promise of honour I made them — for so I interpreted my submissive behaviour — soon drove out these imaginations .\nBesides , I now considered myself as bound by the laws of hospitality , to a people who had treated me with so much expense and magnificence .\nHowever , in my thoughts I could not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals , who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body , while one of my hands was at liberty , without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious a creature as I must appear to them .\nAfter some time , when they observed that I made no more demands for meat , there appeared before me a person of high rank from his imperial majesty .\nHis excellency , having mounted on the small of my right leg , advanced forwards up to my face , with about a dozen of his retinue ; and producing his credentials under the signet royal , which he applied close to my eyes , spoke about ten minutes without any signs of anger , but with a kind of determinate resolution , often pointing forwards , which , as I afterwards found , was towards the capital city , about half a mile distant ; whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I must be conveyed .\nI answered in few words , but to no purpose , and made a sign with my hand that was loose , putting it to the other ( but over his excellency ’s head for fear of hurting him or his train ) and then to my own head and body , to signify that I desired my liberty .\nIt appeared that he understood me well enough , for he shook his head by way of disapprobation , and held his hand in a posture to show that I must be carried as a prisoner .\nHowever , he made other signs to let me understand that I should have meat and drink enough , and very good treatment .\nWhereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds ; but again , when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands , which were all in blisters , and many of the darts still sticking in them , and observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased , I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased .\nUpon this , the _ hurgo _ and his train withdrew , with much civility and cheerful countenances .\nSoon after I heard a general shout , with frequent repetitions of the words _ Peplom selan _ ; and I felt great numbers of people on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree , that I was able to turn upon my right , and to ease myself with making water ; which I very plentifully did , to the great astonishment of the people ; who , conjecturing by my motion what I was going to do , immediately opened to the right and left on that side , to avoid the torrent , which fell with such noise and violence from me .\nBut before this , they had daubed my face and both my hands with a sort of ointment , very pleasant to the smell , which , in a few minutes , removed all the smart of their arrows .\nThese circumstances , added to the refreshment I had received by their victuals and drink , which were very nourishing , disposed me to sleep .\nI slept about eight hours , as I was afterwards assured ; and it was no wonder , for the physicians , by the emperor ’s order , had mingled a sleepy potion in the hogsheads of wine .\n",

    "CHAPTER I RAGGED DICK IS INTRODUCED TO THE READER \" Wake up there , youngster , \" said a rough voice .\nRagged Dick opened his eyes slowly , and stared stupidly in the face of the speaker , but did not offer to get up .\n\" Wake up , you young vagabond ! \"\nsaid the man a little impatiently ; \" I suppose you 'd lay there all day , if I had n't called you . \"\n\" What time is it ? \"\nasked Dick .\n\" Seven o'clock . \"\n\" Seven o'clock !\nI oughter 've been up an hour ago .\nI know what 't was made me so precious sleepy .\nI went to the Old Bowery last night , and did n't turn in till past twelve . \"\n\" You went to the Old Bowery ?\nWhere 'd you get your money ? \"\nasked the man , who was a porter in the employ of a firm doing business on Spruce Street .\n\" Made it by shines , in course .\nMy guardian do n't allow me no money for theatres , so I have to earn it . \"\n\" Some boys get it easier than that , \" said the porter significantly .\n\" You do n't catch me stealin ' , if that 's what you mean , \" said Dick .\n\" Do n't you ever steal , then ? \"\n\" No , and I would n't .\nLots of boys does it , but I would n't . \"\n\" Well , I 'm glad to hear you say that .\nI believe there 's some good in you , Dick , after all . \"\n\" Oh , I 'm a rough customer ! \"\nsaid Dick .\n\" But I would n't steal .\nIt 's mean . \"\n\" I 'm glad you think so , Dick , \" and the rough voice sounded gentler than at first .\n\" Have you got any money to buy your breakfast ? \"\n\" No , but I 'll soon get some . \"\nWhile this conversation had been going on , Dick had got up .\nHis bedchamber had been a wooden box half full of straw , on which the young boot-black had reposed his weary limbs , and slept as soundly as if it had been a bed of down .\nHe dumped down into the straw without taking the trouble of undressing .\nGetting up too was an equally short process .\nHe jumped out of the box , shook himself , picked out one or two straws that had found their way into rents in his clothes , and , drawing a well-worn cap over his uncombed locks , he was all ready for the business of the day .\nDick 's appearance as he stood beside the box was rather peculiar .\nHis pants were torn in several places , and had apparently belonged in the first instance to a boy two sizes larger than himself .\nHe wore a vest , all the buttons of which were gone except two , out of which peeped a shirt which looked as if it had been worn a month .\nTo complete his costume he wore a coat too long for him , dating back , if one might judge from its general appearance , to a remote antiquity .\nWashing the face and hands is usually considered proper in commencing the day , but Dick was above such refinement .\nHe had no particular dislike to dirt , and did not think it necessary to remove several dark streaks on his face and hands .\nBut in spite of his dirt and rags there was something about Dick that was attractive .\nIt was easy to see that if he had been clean and well dressed he would have been decidedly good-looking .\nSome of his companions were sly , and their faces inspired distrust ; but Dick had a frank , straight-forward manner that made him a favorite .\nDick 's business hours had commenced .\nHe had no office to open .\nHis little blacking-box was ready for use , and he looked sharply in the faces of all who passed , addressing each with , \" Shine yer boots , sir ? \"\n\" How much ? \"\nasked a gentleman on his way to his office .\n\" Ten cents , \" said Dick , dropping his box , and sinking upon his knees on the sidewalk , flourishing his brush with the air of one skilled in his profession .\n\" Ten cents !\nIs n't that a little steep ? \"\n\" Well , you know ' taint all clear profit , \" said Dick , who had already set to work .\n\" There 's the _ blacking _ costs something , and I have to get a new brush pretty often . \"\n\" And you have a large rent too , \" said the gentleman quizzically , with a glance at a large hole in Dick 's coat .\n\" Yes , sir , \" said Dick , always ready to joke ; \" I have to pay such a big rent for my manshun up on Fifth Avenoo , that I ca n't afford to take less than ten cents a shine .\nI 'll give you a bully shine , sir . \"\n\" Be quick about it , for I am in a hurry .\nSo your house is on Fifth Avenue , is it ? \"\n\" It is n't anywhere else , \" said Dick , and Dick spoke the truth there .\n\" What tailor do you patronize ? \"\nasked the gentleman , surveying Dick 's attire .\n\" Would you like to go to the same one ? \"\nasked Dick , shrewdly .\n\" Well , no ; it strikes me that he did n't give you a very good fit . \"\n\" This coat once belonged to General Washington , \" said Dick , comically .\n\" He wore it all through the Revolution , and it got torn some , 'cause he fit so hard .\nWhen he died he told his widder to give it to some smart young feller that had n't got none of his own ; so she gave it to me .\nBut if you 'd like it , sir , to remember General Washington by , I 'll let you have it reasonable . \"\n\" Thank you , but I would n't want to deprive you of it .\nAnd did your pants come from General Washington too ? \"\n\" No , they was a gift from Lewis Napoleon .\nLewis had outgrown 'em and sent 'em to me , -- he 's bigger than me , and that 's why they do n't fit . \"\n\" It seems you have distinguished friends .\nNow , my lad , I suppose you would like your money . \"\n\" I should n't have any objection , \" said Dick .\n\" I believe , \" said the gentleman , examining his pocket-book , \" I have n't got anything short of twenty-five cents .\nHave you got any change ? \"\n\" Not a cent , \" said Dick .\n\" All my money 's invested in the Erie Railroad . \"\n\" That 's unfortunate . \"\n\" Shall I get the money changed , sir ? \"\n\" I ca n't wait ; I 've got to meet an appointment immediately .\nI 'll hand you twenty-five cents , and you can leave the change at my office any time during the day . \"\n\" All right , sir .\nWhere is it ? \"\n\" No. 125 Fulton Street .\nShall you remember ? \"\n\" Yes , sir .\nWhat name ? \"\n\" Greyson , -- office on second floor . \"\n\" All right , sir ; I 'll bring it . \"\n\" I wonder whether the little scamp will prove honest , \" said Mr. Greyson to himself , as he walked away .\n\" If he does , I 'll give him my custom regularly .\nIf he do n't as is most likely , I sha n't mind the loss of fifteen cents . \"\nMr. Greyson did n't understand Dick .\nOur ragged hero was n't a model boy in all respects .\nI am afraid he swore sometimes , and now and then he played tricks upon unsophisticated boys from the country , or gave a wrong direction to honest old gentlemen unused to the city .\nA clergyman in search of the Cooper Institute he once directed to the Tombs Prison , and , following him unobserved , was highly delighted when the unsuspicious stranger walked up the front steps of the great stone building on Centre Street , and tried to obtain admission .\n\" I guess he would n't want to stay long if he did get in , \" thought Ragged Dick , hitching up his pants .\n\" Leastways I should n't .\nThey 're so precious glad to see you that they wo n't let you go , but board you gratooitous , and never send in no bills . \"\nAnother of Dick 's faults was his extravagance .\nBeing always wide-awake and ready for business , he earned enough to have supported him comfortably and respectably .\nThere were not a few young clerks who employed Dick from time to time in his professional capacity , who scarcely earned as much as he , greatly as their style and dress exceeded his .\nBut Dick was careless of his earnings .\nWhere they went he could hardly have told himself .\nHowever much he managed to earn during the day , all was generally spent before morning .\nHe was fond of going to the Old Bowery Theatre , and to Tony Pastor 's , and if he had any money left afterwards , he would invite some of his friends in somewhere to have an oyster-stew ; so it seldom happened that he commenced the day with a penny .\nThen I am sorry to add that Dick had formed the habit of smoking .\nThis cost him considerable , for Dick was rather fastidious about his cigars , and would n't smoke the cheapest .\nBesides , having a liberal nature , he was generally ready to treat his companions .\nBut of course the expense was the smallest objection .\nNo boy of fourteen can smoke without being affected injuriously .\nMen are frequently injured by smoking , and boys always .\nBut large numbers of the newsboys and boot-blacks form the habit .\nExposed to the cold and wet they find that it warms them up , and the self-indulgence grows upon them .\nIt is not uncommon to see a little boy , too young to be out of his mother 's sight , smoking with all the apparent satisfaction of a veteran smoker .\nThere was another way in which Dick sometimes lost money .\nThere was a noted gambling-house on Baxter Street , which in the evening was sometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters , who staked their hard earnings , generally losing of course , and refreshing themselves from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a glass .\nSometimes Dick strayed in here , and played with the rest .\nI have mentioned Dick 's faults and defects , because I want it understood , to begin with , that I do n't consider him a model boy .\nBut there were some good points about him nevertheless .\nHe was above doing anything mean or dishonorable .\nHe would not steal , or cheat , or impose upon younger boys , but was frank and straight-forward , manly and self-reliant .\nHis nature was a noble one , and had saved him from all mean faults .\nI hope my young readers will like him as I do , without being blind to his faults .\nPerhaps , although he was only a boot-black , they may find something in him to imitate .\n",

    "PART I At the little town of Vevey , in Switzerland , there is a particularly comfortable hotel .\nThere are , indeed , many hotels , for the entertainment of tourists is the business of the place , which , as many travelers will remember , is seated upon the edge of a remarkably blue lake -- a lake that it behooves every tourist to visit .\nThe shore of the lake presents an unbroken array of establishments of this order , of every category , from the “ grand hotel ” of the newest fashion , with a chalk-white front , a hundred balconies , and a dozen flags flying from its roof , to the little Swiss pension of an elder day , with its name inscribed in German-looking lettering upon a pink or yellow wall and an awkward summerhouse in the angle of the garden .\nOne of the hotels at Vevey , however , is famous , even classical , being distinguished from many of its upstart neighbors by an air both of luxury and of maturity .\nIn this region , in the month of June , American travelers are extremely numerous ; it may be said , indeed , that Vevey assumes at this period some of the characteristics of an American watering place .\nThere are sights and sounds which evoke a vision , an echo , of Newport and Saratoga .\nThere is a flitting hither and thither of “ stylish ” young girls , a rustling of muslin flounces , a rattle of dance music in the morning hours , a sound of high-pitched voices at all times .\nYou receive an impression of these things at the excellent inn of the “ Trois Couronnes ” and are transported in fancy to the Ocean House or to Congress Hall .\nBut at the “ Trois Couronnes , ” it must be added , there are other features that are much at variance with these suggestions : neat German waiters , who look like secretaries of legation ; Russian princesses sitting in the garden ; little Polish boys walking about held by the hand , with their governors ; a view of the sunny crest of the Dent du Midi and the picturesque towers of the Castle of Chillon .\nI hardly know whether it was the analogies or the differences that were uppermost in the mind of a young American , who , two or three years ago , sat in the garden of the “ Trois Couronnes , ” looking about him , rather idly , at some of the graceful objects I have mentioned .\nIt was a beautiful summer morning , and in whatever fashion the young American looked at things , they must have seemed to him charming .\nHe had come from Geneva the day before by the little steamer , to see his aunt , who was staying at the hotel -- Geneva having been for a long time his place of residence .\nBut his aunt had a headache -- his aunt had almost always a headache -- and now she was shut up in her room , smelling camphor , so that he was at liberty to wander about .\nHe was some seven-and-twenty years of age ; when his friends spoke of him , they usually said that he was at Geneva “ studying . ”\nWhen his enemies spoke of him , they said -- but , after all , he had no enemies ; he was an extremely amiable fellow , and universally liked .\nWhat I should say is , simply , that when certain persons spoke of him they affirmed that the reason of his spending so much time at Geneva was that he was extremely devoted to a lady who lived there -- a foreign lady -- a person older than himself .\nVery few Americans -- indeed , I think none -- had ever seen this lady , about whom there were some singular stories .\nBut Winterbourne had an old attachment for the little metropolis of Calvinism ; he had been put to school there as a boy , and he had afterward gone to college there -- circumstances which had led to his forming a great many youthful friendships .\nMany of these he had kept , and they were a source of great satisfaction to him .\nAfter knocking at his aunt ’s door and learning that she was indisposed , he had taken a walk about the town , and then he had come in to his breakfast .\nHe had now finished his breakfast ; but he was drinking a small cup of coffee , which had been served to him on a little table in the garden by one of the waiters who looked like an attache .\nAt last he finished his coffee and lit a cigarette .\nPresently a small boy came walking along the path -- an urchin of nine or ten .\nThe child , who was diminutive for his years , had an aged expression of countenance , a pale complexion , and sharp little features .\nHe was dressed in knickerbockers , with red stockings , which displayed his poor little spindle-shanks ; he also wore a brilliant red cravat .\nHe carried in his hand a long alpenstock , the sharp point of which he thrust into everything that he approached -- the flowerbeds , the garden benches , the trains of the ladies ’ dresses .\nIn front of Winterbourne he paused , looking at him with a pair of bright , penetrating little eyes .\n“ Will you give me a lump of sugar ? ”\nhe asked in a sharp , hard little voice -- a voice immature and yet , somehow , not young .\nWinterbourne glanced at the small table near him , on which his coffee service rested , and saw that several morsels of sugar remained .\n“ Yes , you may take one , ” he answered ; “ but I do n’t think sugar is good for little boys . ”\nThis little boy stepped forward and carefully selected three of the coveted fragments , two of which he buried in the pocket of his knickerbockers , depositing the other as promptly in another place .\nHe poked his alpenstock , lance-fashion , into Winterbourne ’s bench and tried to crack the lump of sugar with his teeth .\n“ Oh , blazes ; it ’s har-r-d ! ”\nhe exclaimed , pronouncing the adjective in a peculiar manner .\nWinterbourne had immediately perceived that he might have the honor of claiming him as a fellow countryman .\n“ Take care you do n’t hurt your teeth , ” he said , paternally .\n“ I have n’t got any teeth to hurt .\nThey have all come out .\nI have only got seven teeth .\nMy mother counted them last night , and one came out right afterward .\nShe said she ’d slap me if any more came out .\nI ca n’t help it .\nIt ’s this old Europe .\nIt ’s the climate that makes them come out .\nIn America they did n’t come out .\nIt ’s these hotels . ”\nWinterbourne was much amused .\n“ If you eat three lumps of sugar , your mother will certainly slap you , ” he said .\n“ She ’s got to give me some candy , then , ” rejoined his young interlocutor .\n“ I ca n’t get any candy here -- any American candy .\nAmerican candy ’s the best candy . ”\n“ And are American little boys the best little boys ? ”\nasked Winterbourne .\n“ I do n’t know .\nI ’m an American boy , ” said the child .\n“ I see you are one of the best ! ”\nlaughed Winterbourne .\n“ Are you an American man ? ”\npursued this vivacious infant .\nAnd then , on Winterbourne ’s affirmative reply -- “ American men are the best , ” he declared .\nHis companion thanked him for the compliment , and the child , who had now got astride of his alpenstock , stood looking about him , while he attacked a second lump of sugar .\nWinterbourne wondered if he himself had been like this in his infancy , for he had been brought to Europe at about this age .\n“ Here comes my sister ! ”\ncried the child in a moment .\n“ She ’s an American girl . ”\nWinterbourne looked along the path and saw a beautiful young lady advancing .\n“ American girls are the best girls , ” he said cheerfully to his young companion .\n“ My sister ai n’t the best ! ”\nthe child declared .\n“ She ’s always blowing at me . ”\n“ I imagine that is your fault , not hers , ” said Winterbourne .\nThe young lady meanwhile had drawn near .\nShe was dressed in white muslin , with a hundred frills and flounces , and knots of pale-colored ribbon .\nShe was bareheaded , but she balanced in her hand a large parasol , with a deep border of embroidery ; and she was strikingly , admirably pretty .\n“ How pretty they are ! ”\nthought Winterbourne , straightening himself in his seat , as if he were prepared to rise .\nThe young lady paused in front of his bench , near the parapet of the garden , which overlooked the lake .\nThe little boy had now converted his alpenstock into a vaulting pole , by the aid of which he was springing about in the gravel and kicking it up not a little .\n“ Randolph , ” said the young lady , “ what ARE you doing ? ”\n“ I ’m going up the Alps , ” replied Randolph .\n“ This is the way ! ”\nAnd he gave another little jump , scattering the pebbles about Winterbourne ’s ears .\n“ That ’s the way they come down , ” said Winterbourne .\n“ He ’s an American man ! ”\ncried Randolph , in his little hard voice .\nThe young lady gave no heed to this announcement , but looked straight at her brother .\n“ Well , I guess you had better be quiet , ” she simply observed .\nIt seemed to Winterbourne that he had been in a manner presented .\nHe got up and stepped slowly toward the young girl , throwing away his cigarette .\n“ This little boy and I have made acquaintance , ” he said , with great civility .\nIn Geneva , as he had been perfectly aware , a young man was not at liberty to speak to a young unmarried lady except under certain rarely occurring conditions ; but here at Vevey , what conditions could be better than these ?\n-- a pretty American girl coming and standing in front of you in a garden .\nThis pretty American girl , however , on hearing Winterbourne ’s observation , simply glanced at him ; she then turned her head and looked over the parapet , at the lake and the opposite mountains .\nHe wondered whether he had gone too far , but he decided that he must advance farther , rather than retreat .\nWhile he was thinking of something else to say , the young lady turned to the little boy again .\n“ I should like to know where you got that pole , ” she said .\n“ I bought it , ” responded Randolph .\n“ You do n’t mean to say you ’re going to take it to Italy ?

    "CHAPTER I Chiswick Mall While the present century was in its teens , and on one sunshiny morning in June , there drove up to the great iron gate of Miss Pinkerton 's academy for young ladies , on Chiswick Mall , a large family coach , with two fat horses in blazing harness , driven by a fat coachman in a three-cornered hat and wig , at the rate of four miles an hour .\nA black servant , who reposed on the box beside the fat coachman , uncurled his bandy legs as soon as the equipage drew up opposite Miss Pinkerton 's shining brass plate , and as he pulled the bell at least a score of young heads were seen peering out of the narrow windows of the stately old brick house .\nNay , the acute observer might have recognized the little red nose of good-natured Miss Jemima Pinkerton herself , rising over some geranium pots in the window of that lady 's own drawing-room .\n\" It is Mrs. Sedley 's coach , sister , \" said Miss Jemima .\n\" Sambo , the black servant , has just rung the bell ; and the coachman has a new red waistcoat . \"\n\" Have you completed all the necessary preparations incident to Miss Sedley 's departure , Miss Jemima ? \"\nasked Miss Pinkerton herself , that majestic lady ; the Semiramis of Hammersmith , the friend of Doctor Johnson , the correspondent of Mrs. Chapone herself .\n\" The girls were up at four this morning , packing her trunks , sister , \" replied Miss Jemima ; \" we have made her a bow-pot . \"\n\" Say a bouquet , sister Jemima , 't is more genteel . \"\n\" Well , a booky as big almost as a haystack ; I have put up two bottles of the gillyflower water for Mrs. Sedley , and the receipt for making it , in Amelia 's box . \"\n\" And I trust , Miss Jemima , you have made a copy of Miss Sedley 's account .\nThis is it , is it ?\nVery good -- ninety-three pounds , four shillings .\nBe kind enough to address it to John Sedley , Esquire , and to seal this billet which I have written to his lady . \"\nIn Miss Jemima 's eyes an autograph letter of her sister , Miss Pinkerton , was an object of as deep veneration as would have been a letter from a sovereign .\nOnly when her pupils quitted the establishment , or when they were about to be married , and once , when poor Miss Birch died of the scarlet fever , was Miss Pinkerton known to write personally to the parents of her pupils ; and it was Jemima 's opinion that if anything could console Mrs. Birch for her daughter 's loss , it would be that pious and eloquent composition in which Miss Pinkerton announced the event .\nIn the present instance Miss Pinkerton 's \" billet \" was to the following effect : -- The Mall , Chiswick , June 15 , 18 MADAM , -- After her six years ' residence at the Mall , I have the honour and happiness of presenting Miss Amelia Sedley to her parents , as a young lady not unworthy to occupy a fitting position in their polished and refined circle .\nThose virtues which characterize the young English gentlewoman , those accomplishments which become her birth and station , will not be found wanting in the amiable Miss Sedley , whose INDUSTRY and OBEDIENCE have endeared her to her instructors , and whose delightful sweetness of temper has charmed her AGED and her YOUTHFUL companions .\nIn music , in dancing , in orthography , in every variety of embroidery and needlework , she will be found to have realized her friends ' fondest wishes .\nIn geography there is still much to be desired ; and a careful and undeviating use of the backboard , for four hours daily during the next three years , is recommended as necessary to the acquirement of that dignified DEPORTMENT AND CARRIAGE , so requisite for every young lady of FASHION .\nIn the principles of religion and morality , Miss Sedley will be found worthy of an establishment which has been honoured by the presence of THE GREAT LEXICOGRAPHER , and the patronage of the admirable Mrs. Chapone .\nIn leaving the Mall , Miss Amelia carries with her the hearts of her companions , and the affectionate regards of her mistress , who has the honour to subscribe herself , Madam , Your most obliged humble servant , BARBARA PINKERTON P.S. -- Miss Sharp accompanies Miss Sedley .\nIt is particularly requested that Miss Sharp 's stay in Russell Square may not exceed ten days .\nThe family of distinction with whom she is engaged , desire to avail themselves of her services as soon as possible .\nThis letter completed , Miss Pinkerton proceeded to write her own name , and Miss Sedley 's , in the fly-leaf of a Johnson 's Dictionary -- the interesting work which she invariably presented to her scholars , on their departure from the Mall .\nOn the cover was inserted a copy of \" Lines addressed to a young lady on quitting Miss Pinkerton 's school , at the Mall ; by the late revered Doctor Samuel Johnson . \"\nIn fact , the Lexicographer 's name was always on the lips of this majestic woman , and a visit he had paid to her was the cause of her reputation and her fortune .\nBeing commanded by her elder sister to get \" the Dictionary \" from the cupboard , Miss Jemima had extracted two copies of the book from the receptacle in question .\nWhen Miss Pinkerton had finished the inscription in the first , Jemima , with rather a dubious and timid air , handed her the second .\n\" For whom is this , Miss Jemima ? \"\nsaid Miss Pinkerton , with awful coldness .\n\" For Becky Sharp , \" answered Jemima , trembling very much , and blushing over her withered face and neck , as she turned her back on her sister .\n\" For Becky Sharp : she 's going too . \"\n\" MISS JEMIMA ! \"\nexclaimed Miss Pinkerton , in the largest capitals .\n\" Are you in your senses ?\nReplace the Dixonary in the closet , and never venture to take such a liberty in future . \"\n\" Well , sister , it 's only two-and-ninepence , and poor Becky will be miserable if she do n't get one . \"\n\" Send Miss Sedley instantly to me , \" said Miss Pinkerton .\nAnd so venturing not to say another word , poor Jemima trotted off , exceedingly flurried and nervous .\nMiss Sedley 's papa was a merchant in London , and a man of some wealth ; whereas Miss Sharp was an articled pupil , for whom Miss Pinkerton had done , as she thought , quite enough , without conferring upon her at parting the high honour of the Dixonary .\nAlthough schoolmistresses ' letters are to be trusted no more nor less than churchyard epitaphs ; yet , as it sometimes happens that a person departs this life who is really deserving of all the praises the stone cutter carves over his bones ; who IS a good Christian , a good parent , child , wife , or husband ; who actually DOES leave a disconsolate family to mourn his loss ; so in academies of the male and female sex it occurs every now and then that the pupil is fully worthy of the praises bestowed by the disinterested instructor .\nNow , Miss Amelia Sedley was a young lady of this singular species ; and deserved not only all that Miss Pinkerton said in her praise , but had many charming qualities which that pompous old Minerva of a woman could not see , from the differences of rank and age between her pupil and herself .\nFor she could not only sing like a lark , or a Mrs. Billington , and dance like Hillisberg or Parisot ; and embroider beautifully ; and spell as well as a Dixonary itself ; but she had such a kindly , smiling , tender , gentle , generous heart of her own , as won the love of everybody who came near her , from Minerva herself down to the poor girl in the scullery , and the one-eyed tart-woman 's daughter , who was permitted to vend her wares once a week to the young ladies in the Mall .\nShe had twelve intimate and bosom friends out of the twenty-four young ladies .\nEven envious Miss Briggs never spoke ill of her ; high and mighty Miss Saltire ( Lord Dexter 's granddaughter ) allowed that her figure was genteel ; and as for Miss Swartz , the rich woolly-haired mulatto from St. Kitt 's , on the day Amelia went away , she was in such a passion of tears that they were obliged to send for Dr. Floss , and half tipsify her with salvolatile .\nMiss Pinkerton 's attachment was , as may be supposed from the high position and eminent virtues of that lady , calm and dignified ; but Miss Jemima had already whimpered several times at the idea of Amelia 's departure ; and , but for fear of her sister , would have gone off in downright hysterics , like the heiress ( who paid double ) of St. Kitt 's .\nSuch luxury of grief , however , is only allowed to parlour-boarders .\nHonest Jemima had all the bills , and the washing , and the mending , and the puddings , and the plate and crockery , and the servants to superintend .\nBut why speak about her ?\nIt is probable that we shall not hear of her again from this moment to the end of time , and that when the great filigree iron gates are once closed on her , she and her awful sister will never issue therefrom into this little world of history .\nBut as we are to see a great deal of Amelia , there is no harm in saying , at the outset of our acquaintance , that she was a dear little creature ; and a great mercy it is , both in life and in novels , which ( and the latter especially ) abound in villains of the most sombre sort , that we are to have for a constant companion so guileless and good-natured a person .\nAs she is not a heroine , there is no need to describe her person ; indeed I am afraid that her nose was rather short than otherwise , and her cheeks a great deal too round and red for a heroine ; but her face blushed with rosy health , and her lips with the freshest of smiles , and she had a pair of eyes which sparkled with the brightest and honestest good-humour , except indeed when they filled with tears , and that was a great deal too often ; for the silly thing would cry over a dead canary-bird ; or over a mouse , that the cat haply had seized upon ; or over the end of a novel , were it ever so stupid ; and as for saying an unkind word to her , were any persons hard-hearted enough to do so -- why , so much the worse for them .\nEven Miss Pinkerton , that austere and godlike woman , ceased scolding her after the first time , and though she no more comprehended sensibility than she did Algebra , gave all masters and teachers particular orders to treat Miss Sedley with the utmost gentleness , as harsh treatment was injurious to her .\n",

    "_ Chapter I _ Miss Marjoribanks lost her mother when she was only fifteen , and when , to add to the misfortune , she was absent at school , and could not have it in her power to soothe her dear mamma 's last moments , as she herself said .\nWords are sometimes very poor exponents of such an event : but it happens now and then , on the other hand , that a plain intimation expresses too much , and suggests emotion and suffering which , in reality , have but little , if any , existence .\nMrs Marjoribanks , poor lady , had been an invalid for many years ; she had grown a little peevish in her loneliness , not feeling herself of much account in this world .\nThere are some rare natures that are content to acquiesce in the general neglect , and forget themselves when they find themselves forgotten ; but it is unfortunately much more usual to take the plan adopted by Mrs Marjoribanks , who devoted all her powers , during the last ten years of her life , to the solacement and care of that poor self which other people neglected .\nThe consequence was , that when she disappeared from her sofa -- except for the mere physical fact that she was no longer there -- no one , except her maid , whose occupation was gone , could have found out much difference .\nHer husband , it is true , who had , somewhere , hidden deep in some secret corner of his physical organisation , the remains of a heart , experienced a certain sentiment of sadness when he re-entered the house from which she had gone away for ever .\nBut Dr Marjoribanks was too busy a man to waste his feelings on a mere sentiment .\nHis daughter , however , was only fifteen , and had floods of tears at her command , as was natural at that age .\nAll the way home she revolved the situation in her mind , which was considerably enlightened by novels and popular philosophy -- for the lady at the head of Miss Marjoribanks school was a devoted admirer of _ Friends in Council _ , and was fond of bestowing that work as a prize , with pencil-marks on the margin -- so that Lucilla 's mind had been cultivated , and was brimful of the best of sentiments .\nShe made up her mind on her journey to a great many virtuous resolutions ; for , in such a case as hers , it was evidently the duty of an only child to devote herself to her father 's comfort , and become the sunshine of his life , as so many young persons of her age have been known to become in literature .\nMiss Marjoribanks had a lively mind , and was capable of grasping all the circumstances of the situation at a glance .\nThus , between the outbreaks of her tears for her mother , it became apparent to her that she must sacrifice her own feelings , and make a cheerful home for papa , and that a great many changes would be necessary in the household -- changes which went so far as even to extend to the furniture .\nMiss Marjoribanks sketched to herself , as she lay back in the corner of the railway carriage , with her veil down , how she would wind herself up to the duty of presiding at her papa 's dinner-parties , and charming everybody by her good humour , and brightness , and devotion to his comfort ; and how , when it was all over , she would withdraw and cry her eyes out in her own room , and be found in the morning languid and worn-out , but always heroical , ready to go downstairs and assist at dear papa 's breakfast , and keep up her smiles for him till he had gone out to his patients .\nAltogether the picture was a very pretty one ; and , considering that a great many young ladies in deep mourning put force upon their feelings in novels , and maintain a smile for the benefit of the unobservant male creatures of whom they have the charge , the idea was not at all extravagant , considering that Miss Marjoribanks was but fifteen .\nShe was not , however , exactly the kind of figure for this _ mise en scène _ .\nWhen her schoolfellows talked of her to their friends -- for Lucilla was already an important personage at Mount Pleasant -- the most common description they gave her was , that she was \" a large girl \" ; and there was great truth in the adjective .\nShe was not to be described as a tall girl -- which conveys an altogether different idea -- but she was large in all particulars , full and well-developed , with somewhat large features , not at all pretty as yet , though it was known in Mount Pleasant that somebody had said that such a face might ripen into beauty , and become \" grandiose , \" for anything anybody could tell .\nMiss Marjoribanks was not vain ; but the word had taken possession of her imagination , as was natural , and solaced her much when she made the painful discovery that her gloves were half a number larger , and her shoes a hair-breadth broader , than those of any of her companions ; but the hands and feet were both perfectly well shaped ; and being at the same time well clothed and plump , were much more presentable and pleasant to look upon than the lean rudimentary schoolgirl hands with which they were surrounded .\nTo add to these excellences , Lucilla had a mass of hair which , if it could but have been cleared a little in its tint , would have been golden , though at present it was nothing more than tawny , and curly to exasperation .\nShe wore it in large thick curls , which did not , however , float or wave , or do any of the graceful things which curls ought to do ; for it had this aggravating quality , that it would not grow long , but would grow ridiculously , unmanageably thick , to the admiration of her companions , but to her own despair , for there was no knowing what to do with those short but ponderous locks .\nThese were the external characteristics of the girl who was going home to be a comfort to her widowed father , and meant to sacrifice herself to his happiness .\nIn the course of her rapid journey she had already settled upon everything that had to be done ; or rather , to speak truly , had rehearsed everything , according to the habit already acquired by a quick mind , a good deal occupied with itself .\nFirst , she meant to fall into her father 's arms -- forgetting , with that singular facility for overlooking the peculiarities of others which belongs to such a character , that Dr Marjoribanks was very little given to embracing , and that a hasty kiss on her forehead was the warmest caress he had ever given his daughter -- and then to rush up to the chamber of death and weep over dear mamma .\n\" And to think I was not there to soothe her last moments ! \"\nLucilla said to herself , with a sob , and with feelings sufficiently real in their way .\nAfter this , the devoted daughter made up her mind to come downstairs again , pale as death , but self-controlled , and devote herself to papa .\nPerhaps , if great emotion should make him tearless , as such cases had been known , Miss Marjoribanks would steal into his arms unawares , and so surprise him into weeping .\nAll this went briskly through her mind , undeterred by the reflection that tears were as much out of the Doctor 's way as embraces ; and in this mood she sped swiftly along in the inspiration of her first sorrow , as she imagined , but in reality to suffer her first disappointment , which was of a less soothing character than that mild and manageable grief .\nWhen Miss Marjoribanks reached home her mother had been dead for twenty-four hours ; and her father was not at the door to receive her as she had expected , but by the bedside of a patient in extremity , who could not consent to go out of the world without the Doctor .\nThis was a sad reversal of her intentions , but Lucilla was not the woman to be disconcerted .\nShe carried out the second part of her programme without either interference or sympathy , except from Mrs Marjoribanks 's maid , who had some hopes from the moment of her arrival .\n\" I ca n't abear to think as I 'm to be parted from you all , miss , \" sobbed the faithful attendant .\n\" I 've lost the best missus as ever was , and I should n't mind going after her .\nWhenever any one gets a good friend in this world , they 're the first to be took away , \" said the weeping handmaiden , who naturally saw her own loss in the most vivid light .\n\" Ah , Ellis , \" cried Miss Marjoribanks , reposing her sorrow in the arms of this anxious attendant , \" we must try to be a comfort to poor papa ! \"\nWith this end Lucilla made herself very troublesome to the sober-minded Doctor during those few dim days before the faint and daily lessening shadow of poor Mrs Marjoribanks was removed altogether from the house .\nWhen that sad ceremony had taken place , and the Doctor returned , serious enough , Heaven knows , to the great house , where the faded helpless woman , who had notwithstanding been his love and his bride in other days , lay no longer on the familiar sofa , the crisis arrived which Miss Marjoribanks had rehearsed so often , but after quite a different fashion .\nThe widower was tearless , indeed , but not from excess of emotion .\nOn the contrary , a painful heaviness possessed him when he became aware how little real sorrow was in his mind , and how small an actual loss was this loss of his wife , which bulked before the world as an event of just as much magnitude as the loss , for example , which poor Mr Lake , the drawing-master , was at the same moment suffering .\nIt was even sad , in another point of view , to think of a human creature passing out of the world , and leaving so little trace that she had ever been there .\nAs for the pretty creature whom Dr Marjoribanks had married , she had vanished into thin air years and years ago .\nThese thoughts were heavy enough -- perhaps even more overwhelming than that grief which develops love to its highest point of intensity .\nBut such were not precisely the kind of reflections which could be solaced by paternal _ attendrissement _ over a weeping and devoted daughter .\nIt was May , and the weather was warm for the season ; but Lucilla had caused the fire to be lighted in the large gloomy library where Dr Marjoribanks always sat in the evenings , with the idea that it would be \" a comfort \" to him ; and , for the same reason , she had ordered tea to be served there , instead of the dinner , for which her father , as she imagined , could have little appetite .\nWhen the Doctor went in to his favourite seclusion , tired and heated and sad -- for even on the day of his wife 's funeral the favourite doctor of Carlingford had patients to think of -- the very heaviness of his thoughts gave warmth to his indignation .\nHe had longed for the quiet and the coolness and the solitude of his library , apart from everybody ; and when he found it radiant with firelight , tea set on the table , and Lucilla crying by the fire , in her new crape , the effect upon a temper by no means perfect may be imagined .\nThe unfortunate man threw both the windows wide open and rang the bell violently , and gave instant orders for the removal of the unnecessary fire and the tea-service .\n\" Let me know when dinner is ready , \" he said , in a voice like thunder ; \" and if Miss Marjoribanks wants a fire , let it be lighted in the drawing-room . \"\nLucilla was so much taken by surprise by this sudden overthrow of her programme , that she submitted , as a girl of much less spirit might have done , and suffered herself and her fire and her tea-things to be dismissed upstairs , where she wept still more at sight of dear mamma 's sofa , and where Ellis came to mingle her tears with those of her young mistress , and to beg dear Miss Lucilla , for the sake of her precious ' elth and her dear papa , to be persuaded to take some tea .\nOn the whole , master stood lessened in the eyes of all the household by his ability to eat his dinner , and his resentment at having his habitudes disturbed .\n\" Them men would eat and drink if we was all in our graves , \" said the indignant cook , who indeed had a real grievance ; and the outraged sentiment of the kitchen was avenged by a bad and hasty dinner , which the Doctor , though generally \" very particular , \" swallowed without remark .\nAbout an hour afterwards he went upstairs to the drawing-room , where Miss Marjoribanks was waiting for him , much less at ease than she had expected to be .\nThough he gave a little sigh at the sight of his wife 's sofa , he did not hesitate to sit down upon it , and even to draw it a little out of its position , which , as Lucilla described afterwards , was like a knife going into her heart .\nThough , indeed , she had herself decided already , in the intervals of her tears , that the drawing-room furniture had got very faded and shabby , and that it would be very expedient to have it renewed for the new reign of youth and energy which was about to commence .\nAs for the Doctor , though Miss Marjoribanks thought him insensible , his heart was heavy enough .\nHis wife had gone out of the world without leaving the least mark of her existence , except in that large girl , whose spirits and forces were unbounded , but whose discretion at the present moment did not seem much greater than her mother 's .\nInstead of thinking of her as a comfort , the Doctor felt himself called upon to face a new and unexpected embarrassment .\nIt would have been a satisfaction to him just then to have been left to himself , and permitted to work on quietly at his profession , and to write his papers for the _ Lancet _ , and to see his friends now and then when he chose ; for Dr Marjoribanks was not a man who had any great need of sympathy by nature , or who was at all addicted to demonstrations of feeling ; consequently , he drew his wife 's sofa a little farther from the fire , and took his seat on it soberly , quite unaware that , by so doing , he was putting a knife into his daughter 's heart .\n",

    "Book I I. On a January evening of the early seventies , Christine Nilsson was singing in Faust at the Academy of Music in New York .\nThough there was already talk of the erection , in remote metropolitan distances \" above the Forties , \" of a new Opera House which should compete in costliness and splendour with those of the great European capitals , the world of fashion was still content to reassemble every winter in the shabby red and gold boxes of the sociable old Academy .\nConservatives cherished it for being small and inconvenient , and thus keeping out the \" new people \" whom New York was beginning to dread and yet be drawn to ; and the sentimental clung to it for its historic associations , and the musical for its excellent acoustics , always so problematic a quality in halls built for the hearing of music .\nIt was Madame Nilsson 's first appearance that winter , and what the daily press had already learned to describe as \" an exceptionally brilliant audience \" had gathered to hear her , transported through the slippery , snowy streets in private broughams , in the spacious family landau , or in the humbler but more convenient \" Brown coupe . \"\nTo come to the Opera in a Brown coupe was almost as honourable a way of arriving as in one 's own carriage ; and departure by the same means had the immense advantage of enabling one ( with a playful allusion to democratic principles ) to scramble into the first Brown conveyance in the line , instead of waiting till the cold-and-gin congested nose of one 's own coachman gleamed under the portico of the Academy .\nIt was one of the great livery-stableman 's most masterly intuitions to have discovered that Americans want to get away from amusement even more quickly than they want to get to it .\nWhen Newland Archer opened the door at the back of the club box the curtain had just gone up on the garden scene .\nThere was no reason why the young man should not have come earlier , for he had dined at seven , alone with his mother and sister , and had lingered afterward over a cigar in the Gothic library with glazed black-walnut bookcases and finial-topped chairs which was the only room in the house where Mrs. Archer allowed smoking .\nBut , in the first place , New York was a metropolis , and perfectly aware that in metropolises it was \" not the thing \" to arrive early at the opera ; and what was or was not \" the thing \" played a part as important in Newland Archer 's New York as the inscrutable totem terrors that had ruled the destinies of his forefathers thousands of years ago .\nThe second reason for his delay was a personal one .\nHe had dawdled over his cigar because he was at heart a dilettante , and thinking over a pleasure to come often gave him a subtler satisfaction than its realisation .\nThis was especially the case when the pleasure was a delicate one , as his pleasures mostly were ; and on this occasion the moment he looked forward to was so rare and exquisite in quality that -- well , if he had timed his arrival in accord with the prima donna 's stage-manager he could not have entered the Academy at a more significant moment than just as she was singing : \" He loves me -- he loves me not -- HE LOVES ME !\n-- \" and sprinkling the falling daisy petals with notes as clear as dew .\nShe sang , of course , \" M'ama ! \"\nand not \" he loves me , \" since an unalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the German text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be translated into Italian for the clearer understanding of English-speaking audiences .\nThis seemed as natural to Newland Archer as all the other conventions on which his life was moulded : such as the duty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue enamel to part his hair , and of never appearing in society without a flower ( preferably a gardenia ) in his buttonhole .\n\" M'ama ... non m ' ama ... \" the prima donna sang , and \" M'ama ! \"\n, with a final burst of love triumphant , as she pressed the dishevelled daisy to her lips and lifted her large eyes to the sophisticated countenance of the little brown Faust-Capoul , who was vainly trying , in a tight purple velvet doublet and plumed cap , to look as pure and true as his artless victim .\nNewland Archer , leaning against the wall at the back of the club box , turned his eyes from the stage and scanned the opposite side of the house .\nDirectly facing him was the box of old Mrs. Manson Mingott , whose monstrous obesity had long since made it impossible for her to attend the Opera , but who was always represented on fashionable nights by some of the younger members of the family .\nOn this occasion , the front of the box was filled by her daughter-in-law , Mrs. Lovell Mingott , and her daughter , Mrs. Welland ; and slightly withdrawn behind these brocaded matrons sat a young girl in white with eyes ecstatically fixed on the stagelovers .\nAs Madame Nilsson 's \" M'ama ! \"\nthrilled out above the silent house ( the boxes always stopped talking during the Daisy Song ) a warm pink mounted to the girl 's cheek , mantled her brow to the roots of her fair braids , and suffused the young slope of her breast to the line where it met a modest tulle tucker fastened with a single gardenia .\nShe dropped her eyes to the immense bouquet of lilies-of-the-valley on her knee , and Newland Archer saw her white-gloved finger-tips touch the flowers softly .\nHe drew a breath of satisfied vanity and his eyes returned to the stage .\nNo expense had been spared on the setting , which was acknowledged to be very beautiful even by people who shared his acquaintance with the Opera houses of Paris and Vienna .\nThe foreground , to the footlights , was covered with emerald green cloth .\nIn the middle distance symmetrical mounds of woolly green moss bounded by croquet hoops formed the base of shrubs shaped like orange-trees but studded with large pink and red roses .\nGigantic pansies , considerably larger than the roses , and closely resembling the floral pen-wipers made by female parishioners for fashionable clergymen , sprang from the moss beneath the rose-trees ; and here and there a daisy grafted on a rose-branch flowered with a luxuriance prophetic of Mr. Luther Burbank 's far-off prodigies .\nIn the centre of this enchanted garden Madame Nilsson , in white cashmere slashed with pale blue satin , a reticule dangling from a blue girdle , and large yellow braids carefully disposed on each side of her muslin chemisette , listened with downcast eyes to M. Capoul 's impassioned wooing , and affected a guileless incomprehension of his designs whenever , by word or glance , he persuasively indicated the ground floor window of the neat brick villa projecting obliquely from the right wing .\n\" The darling ! \"\nthought Newland Archer , his glance flitting back to the young girl with the lilies-of-the-valley .\n\" She does n't even guess what it 's all about . \"\nAnd he contemplated her absorbed young face with a thrill of possessorship in which pride in his own masculine initiation was mingled with a tender reverence for her abysmal purity .\n\" We 'll read Faust together ... by the Italian lakes ... \" he thought , somewhat hazily confusing the scene of his projected honey-moon with the masterpieces of literature which it would be his manly privilege to reveal to his bride .\nIt was only that afternoon that May Welland had let him guess that she \" cared \" ( New York 's consecrated phrase of maiden avowal ) , and already his imagination , leaping ahead of the engagement ring , the betrothal kiss and the march from Lohengrin , pictured her at his side in some scene of old European witchery .\nHe did not in the least wish the future Mrs. Newland Archer to be a simpleton .\nHe meant her ( thanks to his enlightening companionship ) to develop a social tact and readiness of wit enabling her to hold her own with the most popular married women of the \" younger set , \" in which it was the recognised custom to attract masculine homage while playfully discouraging it .\nIf he had probed to the bottom of his vanity ( as he sometimes nearly did ) he would have found there the wish that his wife should be as worldly-wise and as eager to please as the married lady whose charms had held his fancy through two mildly agitated years ; without , of course , any hint of the frailty which had so nearly marred that unhappy being 's life , and had disarranged his own plans for a whole winter .\nHow this miracle of fire and ice was to be created , and to sustain itself in a harsh world , he had never taken the time to think out ; but he was content to hold his view without analysing it , since he knew it was that of all the carefully-brushed , white-waistcoated , button-hole-flowered gentlemen who succeeded each other in the club box , exchanged friendly greetings with him , and turned their opera-glasses critically on the circle of ladies who were the product of the system .\nIn matters intellectual and artistic Newland Archer felt himself distinctly the superior of these chosen specimens of old New York gentility ; he had probably read more , thought more , and even seen a good deal more of the world , than any other man of the number .\nSingly they betrayed their inferiority ; but grouped together they represented \" New York , \" and the habit of masculine solidarity made him accept their doctrine on all the issues called moral .\nHe instinctively felt that in this respect it would be troublesome -- and also rather bad form -- to strike out for himself .\n\" Well -- upon my soul ! \"\nexclaimed Lawrence Lefferts , turning his opera-glass abruptly away from the stage .\nLawrence Lefferts was , on the whole , the foremost authority on \" form \" in New York .\nHe had probably devoted more time than any one else to the study of this intricate and fascinating question ; but study alone could not account for his complete and easy competence .\nOne had only to look at him , from the slant of his bald forehead and the curve of his beautiful fair moustache to the long patent-leather feet at the other end of his lean and elegant person , to feel that the knowledge of \" form \" must be congenital in any one who knew how to wear such good clothes so carelessly and carry such height with so much lounging grace .\nAs a young admirer had once said of him : \" If anybody can tell a fellow just when to wear a black tie with evening clothes and when not to , it 's Larry Lefferts . \"\nAnd on the question of pumps versus patent-leather \" Oxfords \" his authority had never been disputed .\n\" My God ! \"\nhe said ; and silently handed his glass to old Sillerton Jackson .\n",

    "CHAPTER 1 Loomings Call me Ishmael .\nSome years ago -- never mind how long precisely -- having little or no money in my purse , and nothing particular to interest me on shore , I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world .\nIt is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation .\nWhenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth ; whenever it is a damp , drizzly November in my soul ; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses , and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet ; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me , that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street , and methodically knocking people 's hats off -- then , I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can .\nThis is my substitute for pistol and ball .\nWith a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword ; I quietly take to the ship .\nThere is nothing surprising in this .\nIf they but knew it , almost all men in their degree , some time or other , cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me .\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes , belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs -- commerce surrounds it with her surf .\nRight and left , the streets take you waterward .\nIts extreme downtown is the battery , where that noble mole is washed by waves , and cooled by breezes , which a few hours previous were out of sight of land .\nLook at the crowds of water-gazers there .\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon .\nGo from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip , and from thence , by Whitehall , northward .\nWhat do you see ?\n-- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town , stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries .\nSome leaning against the spiles ; some seated upon the pier-heads ; some looking over the bulwarks glasses !\nof ships from China ; some high aloft in the rigging , as if striving to get a still better seaward peep .\nBut these are all landsmen ; of week days pent up in lath and plaster -- tied to counters , nailed to benches , clinched to desks .\nHow then is this ?\nAre the green fields gone ?\nWhat do they here ?\nBut look !\nhere come more crowds , pacing straight for the water , and seemingly bound for a dive .\nStrange !\nNothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land ; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice .\nNo .\nThey must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in .\nAnd there they stand -- miles of them -- leagues .\nInlanders all , they come from lanes and alleys , streets and avenues , -- north , east , south , and west .\nYet here they all unite .\nTell me , does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither ?\nOnce more .\nSay you are in the country ; in some high land of lakes .\nTake almost any path you please , and ten to one it carries you down in a dale , and leaves you there by a pool in the stream .\nThere is magic in it .\nLet the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries -- stand that man on his legs , set his feet a-going , and he will infallibly lead you to water , if water there be in all that region .\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert , try this experiment , if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor .\nYes , as every one knows , meditation and water are wedded for ever .\nBut here is an artist .\nHe desires to paint you the dreamiest , shadiest , quietest , most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco .\nWhat is the chief element he employs ?\nThere stand his trees , each with a hollow trunk , as if a hermit and a crucifix were within ; and here sleeps his meadow , and there sleep his cattle ; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke .\nDeep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way , reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue .\nBut though the picture lies thus tranced , and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd 's head , yet all were vain , unless the shepherd 's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him .\nGo visit the Prairies in June , when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies -- what is the one charm wanting ?\n-- Water there is not a drop of water there !\nWere Niagara but a cataract of sand , would you travel your thousand miles to see it ?\nWhy did the poor poet of Tennessee , upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver , deliberate whether to buy him a coat , which he sadly needed , or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach ?\nWhy is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him , at some time or other crazy to go to sea ?\nWhy upon your first voyage as a passenger , did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration , when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land ?\nWhy did the old Persians hold the sea holy ?\nWhy did the Greeks give it a separate deity , and own brother of Jove ?\nSurely all this is not without meaning .\nAnd still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus , who because he could not grasp the tormenting , mild image he saw in the fountain , plunged into it and was drowned .\nBut that same image , we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans .\nIt is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life ; and this is the key to it all .\nNow , when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes , and begin to be over conscious of my lungs , I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger .\nFor to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse , and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it .\nBesides , passengers get sea-sick -- grow quarrelsome -- do n't sleep of nights -- do not enjoy themselves much , as a general thing ; -- no , I never go as a passenger ; nor , though I am something of a salt , do I ever go to sea as a Commodore , or a Captain , or a Cook .\nI abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them .\nFor my part , I abominate all honorable respectable toils , trials , and tribulations of every kind whatsoever .\nIt is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself , without taking care of ships , barques , brigs , schooners , and what not .\nAnd as for going as cook , -- though I confess there is considerable glory in that , a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board -- yet , somehow , I never fancied broiling fowls ; -- though once broiled , judiciously buttered , and judgmatically salted and peppered , there is no one who will speak more respectfully , not to say reverentially , of a broiled fowl than I will .\nIt is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse , that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids .\nNo , when I go to sea , I go as a simple sailor , right before the mast , plumb down into the fore-castle , aloft there to the royal mast-head .\nTrue , they rather order me about some , and make me jump from spar to spar , like a grasshopper in a May meadow .\nAnd at first , this sort of thing is unpleasant enough .\nIt touches one 's sense of honor , particularly if you come of an old established family in the land , the Van Rensselaers , or Randolphs , or Hardicanutes .\nAnd more than all , if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot , you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster , making the tallest boys stand in awe of you .\nThe transition is a keen one , I assure you , from a schoolmaster to a sailor , and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it .\nBut even this wears off in time .\nWhat of it , if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks ?\nWhat does that indignity amount to , weighed , I mean , in the scales of the New Testament ?\nDo you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me , because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance ?\nWho ai n't a slave ?\nTell me that .\nWell , then , however the old sea-captains may order me about -- however they may thump and punch me about , I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right ; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way -- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view , that is ; and so the universal thump is passed round , and all hands should rub each other 's shoulder-blades , and be content .\nAgain , I always go to sea as a sailor , because they make a point of paying me for my trouble , whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of .\nOn the contrary , passengers themselves must pay .\nAnd there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid .\nThe act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us .\nBut being paid , -- what will compare with it ?\nThe urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous , considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills , and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven .\nAh !\nhow cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition !\nFinally , I always go to sea as a sailor , because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck .\nFor as in this world , head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern ( that is , if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim ) , so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle .\nHe thinks he breathes it first ; but not so .\nIn much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things , at the same time that the leaders little suspect it .\nBut wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor , I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage ; this the invisible police officer of the Fates , who has the constant surveillance of me , and secretly dogs me , and influences me in some unaccountable way -- he can better answer than any one else .\nAnd , doubtless , my going on this whaling voyage , formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago .\nIt came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances .\nI take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this :\n",

    "PROLOGUE THE STORMING OF SERINGAPATAM ( 1799 ) Extracted from a Family Paper I address these lines -- written in India -- to my relatives in England .\nMy object is to explain the motive which has induced me to refuse the right hand of friendship to my cousin , John Herncastle .\nThe reserve which I have hitherto maintained in this matter has been misinterpreted by members of my family whose good opinion I can not consent to forfeit .\nI request them to suspend their decision until they have read my narrative .\nAnd I declare , on my word of honour , that what I am now about to write is , strictly and literally , the truth .\nThe private difference between my cousin and me took its rise in a great public event in which we were both concerned -- the storming of Seringapatam , under General Baird , on the 4th of May , 1799 .\nIn order that the circumstances may be clearly understood , I must revert for a moment to the period before the assault , and to the stories current in our camp of the treasure in jewels and gold stored up in the Palace of Seringapatam .\nII One of the wildest of these stories related to a Yellow Diamond -- a famous gem in the native annals of India .\nThe earliest known traditions describe the stone as having been set in the forehead of the four-handed Indian god who typifies the Moon .\nPartly from its peculiar colour , partly from a superstition which represented it as feeling the influence of the deity whom it adorned , and growing and lessening in lustre with the waxing and waning of the moon , it first gained the name by which it continues to be known in India to this day -- the name of THE MOONSTONE .\nA similar superstition was once prevalent , as I have heard , in ancient Greece and Rome ; not applying , however ( as in India ) , to a diamond devoted to the service of a god , but to a semi-transparent stone of the inferior order of gems , supposed to be affected by the lunar influences -- the moon , in this latter case also , giving the name by which the stone is still known to collectors in our own time .\nThe adventures of the Yellow Diamond begin with the eleventh century of the Christian era .\nAt that date , the Mohammedan conqueror , Mahmoud of Ghizni , crossed India ; seized on the holy city of Somnauth ; and stripped of its treasures the famous temple , which had stood for centuries -- the shrine of Hindoo pilgrimage , and the wonder of the Eastern world .\nOf all the deities worshipped in the temple , the moon-god alone escaped the rapacity of the conquering Mohammedans .\nPreserved by three Brahmins , the inviolate deity , bearing the Yellow Diamond in its forehead , was removed by night , and was transported to the second of the sacred cities of India -- the city of Benares .\nHere , in a new shrine -- in a hall inlaid with precious stones , under a roof supported by pillars of gold -- the moon-god was set up and worshipped .\nHere , on the night when the shrine was completed , Vishnu the Preserver appeared to the three Brahmins in a dream .\nThe deity breathed the breath of his divinity on the Diamond in the forehead of the god .\nAnd the Brahmins knelt and hid their faces in their robes .\nThe deity commanded that the Moonstone should be watched , from that time forth , by three priests in turn , night and day , to the end of the generations of men .\nAnd the Brahmins heard , and bowed before his will .\nThe deity predicted certain disaster to the presumptuous mortal who laid hands on the sacred gem , and to all of his house and name who received it after him .\nAnd the Brahmins caused the prophecy to be written over the gates of the shrine in letters of gold .\nOne age followed another -- and still , generation after generation , the successors of the three Brahmins watched their priceless Moonstone , night and day .\nOne age followed another until the first years of the eighteenth Christian century saw the reign of Aurungzebe , Emperor of the Moguls .\nAt his command havoc and rapine were let loose once more among the temples of the worship of Brahmah .\nThe shrine of the four-handed god was polluted by the slaughter of sacred animals ; the images of the deities were broken in pieces ; and the Moonstone was seized by an officer of rank in the army of Aurungzebe .\nPowerless to recover their lost treasure by open force , the three guardian priests followed and watched it in disguise .\nThe generations succeeded each other ; the warrior who had committed the sacrilege perished miserably ; the Moonstone passed ( carrying its curse with it ) from one lawless Mohammedan hand to another ; and still , through all chances and changes , the successors of the three guardian priests kept their watch , waiting the day when the will of Vishnu the Preserver should restore to them their sacred gem .\nTime rolled on from the first to the last years of the eighteenth Christian century .\nThe Diamond fell into the possession of Tippoo , Sultan of Seringapatam , who caused it to be placed as an ornament in the handle of a dagger , and who commanded it to be kept among the choicest treasures of his armoury .\nEven then -- in the palace of the Sultan himself -- the three guardian priests still kept their watch in secret .\nThere were three officers of Tippoo ’s household , strangers to the rest , who had won their master ’s confidence by conforming , or appearing to conform , to the Mussulman faith ; and to those three men report pointed as the three priests in disguise .\nIII So , as told in our camp , ran the fanciful story of the Moonstone .\nIt made no serious impression on any of us except my cousin -- whose love of the marvellous induced him to believe it .\nOn the night before the assault on Seringapatam , he was absurdly angry with me , and with others , for treating the whole thing as a fable .\nA foolish wrangle followed ; and Herncastle ’s unlucky temper got the better of him .\nHe declared , in his boastful way , that we should see the Diamond on his finger , if the English army took Seringapatam .\nThe sally was saluted by a roar of laughter , and there , as we all thought that night , the thing ended .\nLet me now take you on to the day of the assault .\nMy cousin and I were separated at the outset .\nI never saw him when we forded the river ; when we planted the English flag in the first breach ; when we crossed the ditch beyond ; and , fighting every inch of our way , entered the town .\nIt was only at dusk , when the place was ours , and after General Baird himself had found the dead body of Tippoo under a heap of the slain , that Herncastle and I met .\nWe were each attached to a party sent out by the general ’s orders to prevent the plunder and confusion which followed our conquest .\nThe camp-followers committed deplorable excesses ; and , worse still , the soldiers found their way , by a guarded door , into the treasury of the Palace , and loaded themselves with gold and jewels .\nIt was in the court outside the treasury that my cousin and I met , to enforce the laws of discipline on our own soldiers .\nHerncastle ’s fiery temper had been , as I could plainly see , exasperated to a kind of frenzy by the terrible slaughter through which we had passed .\nHe was very unfit , in my opinion , to perform the duty that had been entrusted to him .\nThere was riot and confusion enough in the treasury , but no violence that I saw .\nThe men ( if I may use such an expression ) disgraced themselves good-humouredly .\nAll sorts of rough jests and catchwords were bandied about among them ; and the story of the Diamond turned up again unexpectedly , in the form of a mischievous joke .\n“ Who ’s got the Moonstone ? ” was the rallying cry which perpetually caused the plundering , as soon as it was stopped in one place , to break out in another .\nWhile I was still vainly trying to establish order , I heard a frightful yelling on the other side of the courtyard , and at once ran towards the cries , in dread of finding some new outbreak of the pillage in that direction .\nI got to an open door , and saw the bodies of two Indians ( by their dress , as I guessed , officers of the palace ) lying across the entrance , dead .\nA cry inside hurried me into a room , which appeared to serve as an armoury .\nA third Indian , mortally wounded , was sinking at the feet of a man whose back was towards me .\nThe man turned at the instant when I came in , and I saw John Herncastle , with a torch in one hand , and a dagger dripping with blood in the other .\nA stone , set like a pommel , in the end of the dagger ’s handle , flashed in the torchlight , as he turned on me , like a gleam of fire .\nThe dying Indian sank to his knees , pointed to the dagger in Herncastle ’s hand , and said , in his native language -- “ The Moonstone will have its vengeance yet on you and yours ! ”\nHe spoke those words , and fell dead on the floor .\nBefore I could stir in the matter , the men who had followed me across the courtyard crowded in .\nMy cousin rushed to meet them , like a madman .\n“ Clear the room ! ” he shouted to me , “ and set a guard on the door ! ”\nThe men fell back as he threw himself on them with his torch and his dagger .\nI put two sentinels of my own company , on whom I could rely , to keep the door .\nThrough the remainder of the night , I saw no more of my cousin .\nEarly in the morning , the plunder still going on , General Baird announced publicly by beat of drum , that any thief detected in the fact , be he whom he might , should be hung .\nThe provost-marshal was in attendance , to prove that the General was in earnest ; and in the throng that followed the proclamation , Herncastle and I met again .\nHe held out his hand , as usual , and said , “ Good morning . ”\nI waited before I gave him my hand in return .\n“ Tell me first , ” I said , “ how the Indian in the armoury met his death , and what those last words meant , when he pointed to the dagger in your hand . ”\n“ The Indian met his death , as I suppose , by a mortal wound , ” said Herncastle .\n“ What his last words meant I know no more than you do . ”\n",

    "CHAPTER I In Chancery London .\nMichaelmas term lately over , and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln 's Inn Hall .\nImplacable November weather .\nAs much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth , and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus , forty feet long or so , waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill .\nSmoke lowering down from chimney-pots , making a soft black drizzle , with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes -- gone into mourning , one might imagine , for the death of the sun .\nDogs , undistinguishable in mire .\nHorses , scarcely better ; splashed to their very blinkers .\nFoot passengers , jostling one another 's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper , and losing their foot-hold at street-corners , where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke ( if this day ever broke ) , adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud , sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement , and accumulating at compound interest .\nFog everywhere .\nFog up the river , where it flows among green aits and meadows ; fog down the river , where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great ( and dirty ) city .\nFog on the Essex marshes , fog on the Kentish heights .\nFog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs ; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships ; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats .\nFog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners , wheezing by the firesides of their wards ; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper , down in his close cabin ; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little ' prentice boy on deck .\nChance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog , with fog all round them , as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds .\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets , much as the sun may , from the spongey fields , be seen to loom by husbandman and ploughboy .\nMost of the shops lighted two hours before their time -- as the gas seems to know , for it has a haggard and unwilling look .\nThe raw afternoon is rawest , and the dense fog is densest , and the muddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction , appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old corporation , Temple Bar .\nAnd hard by Temple Bar , in Lincoln 's Inn Hall , at the very heart of the fog , sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery .\nNever can there come fog too thick , never can there come mud and mire too deep , to assort with the groping and floundering condition which this High Court of Chancery , most pestilent of hoary sinners , holds this day in the sight of heaven and earth .\nOn such an afternoon , if ever , the Lord High Chancellor ought to be sitting here -- as here he is -- with a foggy glory round his head , softly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains , addressed by a large advocate with great whiskers , a little voice , and an interminable brief , and outwardly directing his contemplation to the lantern in the roof , where he can see nothing but fog .\nOn such an afternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar ought to be -- as here they are -- mistily engaged in one of the ten thousand stages of an endless cause , tripping one another up on slippery precedents , groping knee-deep in technicalities , running their goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and making a pretence of equity with serious faces , as players might .\nOn such an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause , some two or three of whom have inherited it from their fathers , who made a fortune by it , ought to be -- as are they not ?\n-- ranged in a line , in a long matted well ( but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom of it ) between the registrar 's red table and the silk gowns , with bills , cross-bills , answers , rejoinders , injunctions , affidavits , issues , references to masters , masters ' reports , mountains of costly nonsense , piled before them .\nWell may the court be dim , with wasting candles here and there ; well may the fog hang heavy in it , as if it would never get out ; well may the stained-glass windows lose their colour and admit no light of day into the place ; well may the uninitiated from the streets , who peep in through the glass panes in the door , be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the drawl , languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the Lord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it and where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank !\nThis is the Court of Chancery , which has its decaying houses and its blighted lands in every shire , which has its worn-out lunatic in every madhouse and its dead in every churchyard , which has its ruined suitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and begging through the round of every man 's acquaintance , which gives to monied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right , which so exhausts finances , patience , courage , hope , so overthrows the brain and breaks the heart , that there is not an honourable man among its practitioners who would not give -- who does not often give -- the warning , \" Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come here ! \"\nWho happen to be in the Lord Chancellor 's court this murky afternoon besides the Lord Chancellor , the counsel in the cause , two or three counsel who are never in any cause , and the well of solicitors before mentioned ?\nThere is the registrar below the judge , in wig and gown ; and there are two or three maces , or petty-bags , or privy purses , or whatever they may be , in legal court suits .\nThese are all yawning , for no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce ( the cause in hand ) , which was squeezed dry years upon years ago .\nThe short-hand writers , the reporters of the court , and the reporters of the newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when Jarndyce and Jarndyce comes on .\nTheir places are a blank .\nStanding on a seat at the side of the hall , the better to peer into the curtained sanctuary , is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is always in court , from its sitting to its rising , and always expecting some incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour .\nSome say she really is , or was , a party to a suit , but no one knows for certain because no one cares .\nShe carries some small litter in a reticule which she calls her documents , principally consisting of paper matches and dry lavender .\nA sallow prisoner has come up , in custody , for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application \" to purge himself of his contempt , \" which , being a solitary surviving executor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts of which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge , he is not at all likely ever to do .\nIn the meantime his prospects in life are ended .\nAnother ruined suitor , who periodically appears from Shropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at the close of the day 's business and who can by no means be made to understand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence after making it desolate for a quarter of a century , plants himself in a good place and keeps an eye on the judge , ready to call out \" My Lord ! \"\nin a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising .\nA few lawyers ' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger on the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal weather a little .\nJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on .\nThis scarecrow of a suit has , in course of time , become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means .\nThe parties to it understand it least , but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises .\nInnumerable children have been born into the cause ; innumerable young people have married into it ; innumerable old people have died out of it .\nScores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how or why ; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the suit .\nThe little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown up , possessed himself of a real horse , and trotted away into the other world .\nFair wards of court have faded into mothers and grandmothers ; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out ; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere bills of mortality ; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffee-house in Chancery Lane ; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the court , perennially hopeless .\nJarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke .\nThat is the only good that has ever come of it .\nIt has been death to many , but it is a joke in the profession .\nEvery master in Chancery has had a reference out of it .\nEvery Chancellor was \" in it , \" for somebody or other , when he was counsel at the bar .\nGood things have been said about it by blue-nosed , bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee after dinner in hall .\nArticled clerks have been in the habit of fleshing their legal wit upon it .\nThe last Lord Chancellor handled it neatly , when , correcting Mr. Blowers , the eminent silk gown who said that such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes , he observed , \" or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce , Mr. Blowers \" -- a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces , bags , and purses .\nHow many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched forth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide question .\nFrom the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty warrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many shapes , down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks ' Office who has copied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that eternal heading , no man 's nature has been made better by it .\nIn trickery , evasion , procrastination , spoliation , botheration , under false pretences of all sorts , there are influences that can never come to good .\nThe very solicitors ' boys who have kept the wretched suitors at bay , by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle , Mizzle , or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments until dinner , may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .\nThe receiver in the cause has acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a distrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind .\nChizzle , Mizzle , and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising themselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter and see what can be done for Drizzle -- who was not well used -- when Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office .\nShirking and sharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the ill-fated cause ; and even those who have contemplated its history from the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course , and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some off-hand manner never meant to go right .\n",

    "CHAPTER I .\nThe Coming of a Native Son The Happy Family , waiting for the Sunday supper call , were grouped around the open door of the bunk-house , gossiping idly of things purely local , when the Old Man returned from the Stock Association at Helena ; beside him on the buggy seat sat a stranger .\nThe Old Man pulled up at the bunk-house , the stranger sprang out over the wheel with the agility which bespoke youthful muscles , and the Old Man introduced him with a quirk of the lips : “ This is Mr. Mig-u-ell Rapponi , boys -- a peeler straight from the Golden Gate .\nThrow out your war-bag and make yourself to home , Mig-u-ell ; some of the boys 'll show you where to bed down . ”\nThe Old Man drove on to the house with his own luggage , and Happy Jack followed to take charge of the team ; but the remainder of the Happy Family unobtrusively took the measure of the foreign element .\nFrom his black-and-white horsehair hatband , with tassels that swept to the very edge of his gray hatbrim , to the crimson silk neckerchief draped over the pale blue bosom of his shirt ; from the beautifully stamped leather cuffs , down to the exaggerated height of his tan boot-heels , their critical eyes swept in swift , appraising glances ; and unanimous disapproval was the result .\nThe Happy Family had themselves an eye to picturesque garb upon occasion , but this passed even Pink 's love of display .\n“ He 's some gaudy to look at , ” Irish murmured under his breath to Cal Emmett .\n“ All he lacks is a spot-light and a brass band , ” Cal returned , in much the same tone with which a woman remarks upon a last season 's hat on the head of a rival .\nMiguel was not embarrassed by the inspection .\nHe was tall , straight , and swarthily handsome , and he stood with the complacence of a stage favorite waiting for the applause to cease so that he might speak his first lines ; and , while he waited , he sifted tobacco into a cigarette paper daintily , with his little finger extended .\nThere was a ring upon that finger ; a ring with a moonstone setting as large and round as the eye of a startled cat , and the Happy Family caught the pale gleam of it and drew a long breath .\nHe lighted a match nonchalantly , by the artfully simple method of pinching the head of it with his fingernails , leaned negligently against the wall of the bunk-house , and regarded the group incuriously while he smoked .\n“ Any pretty girls up this way ? ” he inquired languidly , after a moment , fanning a thin smoke-cloud from before his face while he spoke .\nThe Happy Family went prickly hot .\nThe girls in that neighborhood were held in esteem , and there was that in his tone which gave offense .\n“ Sure , there 's pretty girls here ! ”\nBig Medicine bellowed unexpectedly , close beside him .\n“ We 're all of us engaged to ` em , by cripes ! ”\nMiguel shot an oblique glance at Big Medicine , examined the end of his cigarette , and gave a lift of shoulder , which might mean anything or nothing , and so was irritating to a degree .\nHe did not pursue the subject further , and so several belated retorts were left tickling futilely the tongues of the Happy Family -- which does not make for amiability .\nTo a man they liked him little , in spite of their easy friendliness with mankind in general .\nAt supper they talked with him perfunctorily , and covertly sneered because he sprinkled his food liberally with cayenne and his speech with Spanish words pronounced with soft , slurred vowels that made them sound unfamiliar , and against which his English contrasted sharply with its crisp , American enunciation .\nHe met their infrequent glances with the cool stare of absolute indifference to their opinion of him , and their perfunctory civility with introspective calm .\nThe next morning , when there was riding to be done , and Miguel appeared at the last moment in his working clothes , even Weary , the sunny-hearted , had an unmistakable curl of his lip after the first glance .\nMiguel wore the hatband , the crimson kerchief tied loosely with the point draped over his chest , the stamped leather cuffs and the tan boots with the highest heels ever built by the cobbler craft .\nAlso , the lower half of him was incased in chaps the like of which had never before been brought into Flying U coulee .\nBlack Angora chaps they were ; long-haired , crinkly to the very hide , with three white , diamond-shaped patches running down each leg of them , and with the leather waistband stamped elaborately to match the cuffs .\nThe bands of his spurs were two inches wide and inlaid to the edge with beaten silver , and each concho was engraved to represent a large , wild rose , with a golden center .\nA dollar laid upon the rowels would have left a fringe of prongs all around .\nHe bent over his sacked riding outfit , and undid it , revealing a wonderful saddle of stamped leather inlaid on skirt and cantle with more beaten silver .\nHe straightened the skirts , carefully ignoring the glances thrown in his direction , and swore softly to himself when he discovered where the leather had been scratched through the canvas wrappings and the end of the silver scroll ripped up .\nHe drew out his bridle and shook it into shape , and the silver mountings and the reins of braided leather with horsehair tassels made Happy Jack 's eyes greedy with desire .\nHis blanket was a scarlet Navajo , and his rope a rawhide lariat .\nAltogether , his splendor when he was mounted so disturbed the fine mental poise of the Happy Family that they left him jingling richly off by himself , while they rode closely grouped and discussed him acrimoniously .\n“ By gosh , a man might do worse than locate that Native Son for a silver mine , ” Cal began , eyeing the interloper scornfully .\n“ It 's plumb wicked to ride around with all that wealth and fussy stuff .\nHe must ' a ' robbed a bank and put the money all into a riding outfit . ”\n“ By golly , he looks to me like a pair uh trays when he comes bow-leggin ' along with them white diamonds on his legs , ” Slim stated solemnly .\n“ And I 'll gamble that 's a spot higher than he stacks up in the cow game , ” Pink observed with the pessimism which matrimony had given him .\n“ You mind him asking about bad horses , last night ?\nThat Lizzie-boy never saw a bad horse ; they do n't grow 'em where he come from .\nWhat they do n't know about riding they make up for with a swell rig -- ” “ And , oh , mamma !\nIt sure is a swell rig ! ”\nWeary paid generous tribute .\n“ Only I will say old Banjo reminds me of an Irish cook rigged out in silk and diamonds .\nThat outfit on Glory , now -- ” He sighed enviously .\n“ Well , I 've gone up against a few real ones in my long and varied career , ” Irish remarked reminiscently , “ and I 've noticed that a hoss never has any respect or admiration for a swell rig .\nWhen he gets real busy it ai n't the silver filigree stuff that 's going to help you hold connections with your saddle , and a silver-mounted bridle-bit ai n't a darned bit better than a plain one . ”\n“ Just take a look at him ! ” cried Pink , with intense disgust .\n“ Ambling off there , so the sun can strike all that silver and bounce back in our eyes .\nAnd that braided lariat -- I 'd sure love to see the pieces if he ever tries to anchor anything bigger than a yearling ! ”\n“ Why , you do n't think for a minute he could ever get out and rope anything , do yuh ? ”\nIrish laughed .\n“ That there Native Son throws on a-w-l-together too much dog to really get out and do anything . ”\n“ Aw , ” fleered Happy Jack , “ he ai n't any Natiff Son .\nHe 's a dago ! ”\n“ He 's got the earmarks uh both , ” Big Medicine stated authoritatively .\n“ I know 'em , by cripes , and I know their ways . ”\nHe jerked his thumb toward the dazzling Miguel .\n“ I can tell yuh the kinda cow-puncher he is ; I 've saw 'em workin ' at it .\nHaw-haw-haw !\nThey 'll start out to move ten or a dozen head uh tame old cows from one field to another , and there 'll be six or eight fellers , rigged up like this here tray-spot , ridin ' along , important as hell , drivin ' them few cows down a lane , with peach trees on both sides , by cripes , jingling their big , silver spurs , all wearin ' fancy chaps to ride four or five miles down the road .\nHonest to grandma , they call that punchin ' cows !\nOh , he 's a Native Son , all right .\nI 've saw lots of 'em , only I never saw one so far away from the Promised Land before .\nThat there looks queer to me .\nNatiff Sons -- the real ones , like him -- are as scarce outside Calyforny as buffalo are right here in this coulee . ”\n“ That 's the way they do it , all right , ” Irish agreed .\n“ And then they 'll have a ' rodeo ' -- ” “ Haw-haw-haw ! ”\nBig Medicine interrupted , and took up the tale , which might have been entitled “ Some Cowpunching I Have Seen . ”\n“ They have them rodeos on a Sunday , mostly , and they invite everybody to it , like it was a picnic .\nAnd there 'll be two or three fellers to every calf , all lit up , like Mig-u-ell , over there , in chaps and silver fixin 's , fussin ' around on horseback in a corral , and every feller trying to pile his rope on the same calf , by cripes !\nThey stretch 'em out with two ropes -- calves , remember !\nLittle , weenty fellers you could pack under one arm !\nYuh ca n't blame 'em much .\nThey never have more 'n thirty or forty head to brand at a time , and they never git more 'n a taste uh real work .\nSo they make the most uh what they git , and go in heavy on fancy outfits .\nAnd this here silver-mounted fellow thinks he 's a real cowpuncher , by cripes ! ”\nThe Happy Family laughed at the idea ; laughed so loud that Miguel left his lonely splendor and swung over to them , ostensibly to borrow a match .\n“ What 's the joke ? ” he inquired languidly , his chin thrust out and his eyes upon the match blazing at the end of his cigarette .\n",

    "CHAPTER I You must go back with me to the autumn of 1827 .\nMy father , as you know , was a sort of gentleman farmer in — shire ; and I , by his express desire , succeeded him in the same quiet occupation , not very willingly , for ambition urged me to higher aims , and self-conceit assured me that , in disregarding its voice , I was burying my talent in the earth , and hiding my light under a bushel .\nMy mother had done her utmost to persuade me that I was capable of great achievements ; but my father , who thought ambition was the surest road to ruin , and change but another word for destruction , would listen to no scheme for bettering either my own condition , or that of my fellow mortals .\nHe assured me it was all rubbish , and exhorted me , with his dying breath , to continue in the good old way , to follow his steps , and those of his father before him , and let my highest ambition be to walk honestly through the world , looking neither to the right hand nor to the left , and to transmit the paternal acres to my children in , at least , as flourishing a condition as he left them to me .\n‘ Well !\n— an honest and industrious farmer is one of the most useful members of society ; and if I devote my talents to the cultivation of my farm , and the improvement of agriculture in general , I shall thereby benefit , not only my own immediate connections and dependants , but , in some degree , mankind at large : — hence I shall not have lived in vain . ’\nWith such reflections as these I was endeavouring to console myself , as I plodded home from the fields , one cold , damp , cloudy evening towards the close of October .\nBut the gleam of a bright red fire through the parlour window had more effect in cheering my spirits , and rebuking my thankless repinings , than all the sage reflections and good resolutions I had forced my mind to frame ; — for I was young then , remember — only four-and-twenty — and had not acquired half the rule over my own spirit that I now possess — trifling as that may be .\nHowever , that haven of bliss must not be entered till I had exchanged my miry boots for a clean pair of shoes , and my rough surtout for a respectable coat , and made myself generally presentable before decent society ; for my mother , with all her kindness , was vastly particular on certain points .\nIn ascending to my room I was met upon the stairs by a smart , pretty girl of nineteen , with a tidy , dumpy figure , a round face , bright , blooming cheeks , glossy , clustering curls , and little merry brown eyes .\nI need not tell you this was my sister Rose .\nShe is , I know , a comely matron still , and , doubtless , no less lovely — in your eyes — than on the happy day you first beheld her .\nNothing told me then that she , a few years hence , would be the wife of one entirely unknown to me as yet , but destined hereafter to become a closer friend than even herself , more intimate than that unmannerly lad of seventeen , by whom I was collared in the passage , on coming down , and well-nigh jerked off my equilibrium , and who , in correction for his impudence , received a resounding whack over the sconce , which , however , sustained no serious injury from the infliction ; as , besides being more than commonly thick , it was protected by a redundant shock of short , reddish curls , that my mother called auburn .\nOn entering the parlour we found that honoured lady seated in her arm-chair at the fireside , working away at her knitting , according to her usual custom , when she had nothing else to do .\nShe had swept the hearth , and made a bright blazing fire for our reception ; the servant had just brought in the tea-tray ; and Rose was producing the sugar-basin and tea-caddy from the cupboard in the black oak side-board , that shone like polished ebony , in the cheerful parlour twilight .\n‘ Well !\nhere they both are , ’ cried my mother , looking round upon us without retarding the motion of her nimble fingers and glittering needles .\n‘ Now shut the door , and come to the fire , while Rose gets the tea ready ; I ’m sure you must be starved ; — and tell me what you ’ve been about all day ; — I like to know what my children have been about . ’\n‘ I ’ve been breaking in the grey colt — no easy business that — directing the ploughing of the last wheat stubble — for the ploughboy has not the sense to direct himself — and carrying out a plan for the extensive and efficient draining of the low meadowlands . ’\n‘ That ’s my brave boy !\n— and Fergus , what have you been doing ? ’\n‘ Badger-baiting . ’\nAnd here he proceeded to give a particular account of his sport , and the respective traits of prowess evinced by the badger and the dogs ; my mother pretending to listen with deep attention , and watching his animated countenance with a degree of maternal admiration I thought highly disproportioned to its object .\n‘ It ’s time you should be doing something else , Fergus , ’ said I , as soon as a momentary pause in his narration allowed me to get in a word .\n‘ What can I do ? ’\nreplied he ; ‘ my mother wo n’t let me go to sea or enter the army ; and I ’m determined to do nothing else — except make myself such a nuisance to you all , that you will be thankful to get rid of me on any terms . ’\nOur parent soothingly stroked his stiff , short curls .\nHe growled , and tried to look sulky , and then we all took our seats at the table , in obedience to the thrice-repeated summons of Rose .\n‘ Now take your tea , ’ said she ; ‘ and I ’ll tell you what I ’ve been doing .\nI ’ve been to call on the Wilsons ; and it ’s a thousand pities you did n’t go with me , Gilbert , for Eliza Millward was there ! ’\n‘ Well !\nwhat of her ? ’\n‘ Oh , nothing !\n— I ’m not going to tell you about her ; — only that she ’s a nice , amusing little thing , when she is in a merry humour , and I should n’t mind calling her — ’ ‘ Hush , hush , my dear !\nyour brother has no such idea ! ’\nwhispered my mother earnestly , holding up her finger .\n‘ Well , ’ resumed Rose ; ‘ I was going to tell you an important piece of news I heard there — I have been bursting with it ever since .\nYou know it was reported a month ago , that somebody was going to take Wildfell Hall — and — what do you think ?\nIt has actually been inhabited above a week !\n— and we never knew ! ’\n‘ Impossible ! ’\ncried my mother .\n‘ Preposterous !!! ’\nshrieked Fergus .\n‘ It has indeed !\n— and by a single lady ! ’\n‘ Good gracious , my dear !\nThe place is in ruins ! ’\n‘ She has had two or three rooms made habitable ; and there she lives , all alone — except an old woman for a servant ! ’\n‘ Oh , dear !\nthat spoils it — I ’d hoped she was a witch , ’ observed Fergus , while carving his inch-thick slice of bread and butter .\n‘ Nonsense , Fergus !\nBut is n’t it strange , mamma ? ’\n‘ Strange !\nI can hardly believe it . ’\n‘ But you may believe it ; for Jane Wilson has seen her .\nShe went with her mother , who , of course , when she heard of a stranger being in the neighbourhood , would be on pins and needles till she had seen her and got all she could out of her .\nShe is called Mrs. Graham , and she is in mourning — not widow ’s weeds , but slightish mourning — and she is quite young , they say , — not above five or six and twenty , — but so reserved !\nThey tried all they could to find out who she was and where she came from , and , all about her , but neither Mrs. Wilson , with her pertinacious and impertinent home-thrusts , nor Miss Wilson , with her skilful manoeuvring , could manage to elicit a single satisfactory answer , or even a casual remark , or chance expression calculated to allay their curiosity , or throw the faintest ray of light upon her history , circumstances , or connections .\nMoreover , she was barely civil to them , and evidently better pleased to say ‘ good-by , ’ than ‘ how do you do . ’\nBut Eliza Millward says her father intends to call upon her soon , to offer some pastoral advice , which he fears she needs , as , though she is known to have entered the neighbourhood early last week , she did not make her appearance at church on Sunday ; and she — Eliza , that is — will beg to accompany him , and is sure she can succeed in wheedling something out of her — you know , Gilbert , she can do anything .\nAnd we should call some time , mamma ; it ’s only proper , you know . ’\n‘ Of course , my dear .\nPoor thing !\nHow lonely she must feel ! ’\n‘ And pray , be quick about it ; and mind you bring me word how much sugar she puts in her tea , and what sort of caps and aprons she wears , and all about it ; for I do n’t know how I can live till I know , ’ said Fergus , very gravely .\nBut if he intended the speech to be hailed as a master-stroke of wit , he signally failed , for nobody laughed .\nHowever , he was not much disconcerted at that ; for when he had taken a mouthful of bread and butter and was about to swallow a gulp of tea , the humour of the thing burst upon him with such irresistible force , that he was obliged to jump up from the table , and rush snorting and choking from the room ; and a minute after , was heard screaming in fearful agony in the garden .\nAs for me , I was hungry , and contented myself with silently demolishing the tea , ham , and toast , while my mother and sister went on talking , and continued to discuss the apparent or non-apparent circumstances , and probable or improbable history of the mysterious lady ; but I must confess that , after my brother ’s misadventure , I once or twice raised the cup to my lips , and put it down again without daring to taste the contents , lest I should injure my dignity by a similar explosion .\n",

    "BOOK ONE THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS CHAPTER ONE THE EVE OF THE WAR No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man 's and yet as mortal as his own ; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and studied , perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water .\nWith infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe about their little affairs , serene in their assurance of their empire over matter .\nIt is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same .\nNo one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources of human danger , or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life upon them as impossible or improbable .\nIt is curious to recall some of the mental habits of those departed days .\nAt most terrestrial men fancied there might be other men upon Mars , perhaps inferior to themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise .\nYet across the gulf of space , minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish , intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic , regarded this earth with envious eyes , and slowly and surely drew their plans against us .\nAnd early in the twentieth century came the great disillusionment .\nThe planet Mars , I scarcely need remind the reader , revolves about the sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles , and the light and heat it receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world .\nIt must be , if the nebular hypothesis has any truth , older than our world ; and long before this earth ceased to be molten , life upon its surface must have begun its course .\nThe fact that it is scarcely one seventh of the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the temperature at which life could begin .\nIt has air and water and all that is necessary for the support of animated existence .\nYet so vain is man , and so blinded by his vanity , that no writer , up to the very end of the nineteenth century , expressed any idea that intelligent life might have developed there far , or indeed at all , beyond its earthly level .\nNor was it generally understood that since Mars is older than our earth , with scarcely a quarter of the superficial area and remoter from the sun , it necessarily follows that it is not only more distant from time 's beginning but nearer its end .\nThe secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already gone far indeed with our neighbour .\nIts physical condition is still largely a mystery , but we know now that even in its equatorial region the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter .\nIts air is much more attenuated than ours , its oceans have shrunk until they cover but a third of its surface , and as its slow seasons change huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically inundate its temperate zones .\nThat last stage of exhaustion , which to us is still incredibly remote , has become a present-day problem for the inhabitants of Mars .\nThe immediate pressure of necessity has brightened their intellects , enlarged their powers , and hardened their hearts .\nAnd looking across space with instruments , and intelligences such as we have scarcely dreamed of , they see , at its nearest distance only 35,000,000 of miles sunward of them , a morning star of hope , our own warmer planet , green with vegetation and grey with water , with a cloudy atmosphere eloquent of fertility , with glimpses through its drifting cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow , navy-crowded seas .\nAnd we men , the creatures who inhabit this earth , must be to them at least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us .\nThe intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant struggle for existence , and it would seem that this too is the belief of the minds upon Mars .\nTheir world is far gone in its cooling and this world is still crowded with life , but crowded only with what they regard as inferior animals .\nTo carry warfare sunward is , indeed , their only escape from the destruction that , generation after generation , creeps upon them .\nAnd before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless and utter destruction our own species has wrought , not only upon animals , such as the vanished bison and the dodo , but upon its inferior races .\nThe Tasmanians , in spite of their human likeness , were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants , in the space of fifty years .\nAre we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit ?\nThe Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing subtlety -- their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of ours -- and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh perfect unanimity .\nHad our instruments permitted it , we might have seen the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century .\nMen like Schiaparelli watched the red planet -- it is odd , by-the-bye , that for countless centuries Mars has been the star of war -- but failed to interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so well .\nAll that time the Martians must have been getting ready .\nDuring the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated part of the disk , first at the Lick Observatory , then by Perrotin of Nice , and then by other observers .\nEnglish readers heard of it first in the issue of _ Nature _ dated August 2 .\nI am inclined to think that this blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun , in the vast pit sunk into their planet , from which their shots were fired at us .\nPeculiar markings , as yet unexplained , were seen near the site of that outbreak during the next two oppositions .\nThe storm burst upon us six years ago now .\nAs Mars approached opposition , Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of incandescent gas upon the planet .\nIt had occurred towards midnight of the twelfth ; and the spectroscope , to which he had at once resorted , indicated a mass of flaming gas , chiefly hydrogen , moving with an enormous velocity towards this earth .\nThis jet of fire had become invisible about a quarter past twelve .\nHe compared it to a colossal puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet , \" as flaming gases rushed out of a gun . \"\nA singularly appropriate phrase it proved .\nYet the next day there was nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _ Daily Telegraph _ , and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest dangers that ever threatened the human race .\nI might not have heard of the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy , the well-known astronomer , at Ottershaw .\nHe was immensely excited at the news , and in the excess of his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a scrutiny of the red planet .\nIn spite of all that has happened since , I still remember that vigil very distinctly : the black and silent observatory , the shadowed lantern throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner , the steady ticking of the clockwork of the telescope , the little slit in the roof -- an oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it .\nOgilvy moved about , invisible but audible .\nLooking through the telescope , one saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field .\nIt seemed such a little thing , so bright and small and still , faintly marked with transverse stripes , and slightly flattened from the perfect round .\nBut so little it was , so silvery warm -- a pin 's - head of light !\nIt was as if it quivered , but really this was the telescope vibrating with the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view .\nAs I watched , the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to advance and recede , but that was simply that my eye was tired .\nForty millions of miles it was from us -- more than forty millions of miles of void .\nFew people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of the material universe swims .\nNear it in the field , I remember , were three faint points of light , three telescopic stars infinitely remote , and all around it was the unfathomable darkness of empty space .\nYou know how that blackness looks on a frosty starlight night .\nIn a telescope it seems far profounder .\nAnd invisible to me because it was so remote and small , flying swiftly and steadily towards me across that incredible distance , drawing nearer every minute by so many thousands of miles , came the Thing they were sending us , the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity and death to the earth .\nI never dreamed of it then as I watched ; no one on earth dreamed of that unerring missile .\nThat night , too , there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet .\nI saw it .\nA reddish flash at the edge , the slightest projection of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight ; and at that I told Ogilvy and he took my place .\nThe night was warm and I was thirsty , and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the darkness , to the little table where the siphon stood , while Ogilvy exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us .\nThat night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth from Mars , just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first one .\nI remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness , with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes .\nI wished I had a light to smoke by , little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I had seen and all that it would presently bring me .\nOgilvy watched till one , and then gave it up ; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his house .\nDown below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all their hundreds of people , sleeping in peace .\nHe was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars , and scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were signalling us .\nHis idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy shower upon the planet , or that a huge volcanic explosion was in progress .\nHe pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets .\n",

    "CHAPTER I At sunset hour the forest was still , lonely , sweet with tang of fir and spruce , blazing in gold and red and green ; and the man who glided on under the great trees seemed to blend with the colors and , disappearing , to have become a part of the wild woodland .\nOld Baldy , highest of the White Mountains , stood up round and bare , rimmed bright gold in the last glow of the setting sun .\nThen , as the fire dropped behind the domed peak , a change , a cold and darkening blight , passed down the black spear-pointed slopes over all that mountain world .\nIt was a wild , richly timbered , and abundantly watered region of dark forests and grassy parks , ten thousand feet above sea-level , isolated on all sides by the southern Arizona desert -- the virgin home of elk and deer , of bear and lion , of wolf and fox , and the birthplace as well as the hiding-place of the fierce Apache .\nSeptember in that latitude was marked by the sudden cool night breeze following shortly after sundown .\nTwilight appeared to come on its wings , as did faint sounds , not distinguishable before in the stillness .\nMilt Dale , man of the forest , halted at the edge of a timbered ridge , to listen and to watch .\nBeneath him lay a narrow valley , open and grassy , from which rose a faint murmur of running water .\nIts music was pierced by the wild staccato yelp of a hunting coyote .\nFrom overhead in the giant fir came a twittering and rustling of grouse settling for the night ; and from across the valley drifted the last low calls of wild turkeys going to roost .\nTo Dale 's keen ear these sounds were all they should have been , betokening an unchanged serenity of forestland .\nHe was glad , for he had expected to hear the clipclop of white men 's horses -- which to hear up in those fastnesses was hateful to him .\nHe and the Indian were friends .\nThat fierce foe had no enmity toward the lone hunter .\nBut there hid somewhere in the forest a gang of bad men , sheep-thieves , whom Dale did not want to meet .\nAs he started out upon the slope , a sudden flaring of the afterglow of sunset flooded down from Old Baldy , filling the valley with lights and shadows , yellow and blue , like the radiance of the sky .\nThe pools in the curves of the brook shone darkly bright .\nDale 's gaze swept up and down the valley , and then tried to pierce the black shadows across the brook where the wall of spruce stood up , its speared and spiked crest against the pale clouds .\nThe wind began to moan in the trees and there was a feeling of rain in the air .\nDale , striking a trail , turned his back to the fading afterglow and strode down the valley .\nWith night at hand and a rain-storm brewing , he did not head for his own camp , some miles distant , but directed his steps toward an old log cabin .\nWhen he reached it darkness had almost set in .\nHe approached with caution .\nThis cabin , like the few others scattered in the valleys , might harbor Indians or a bear or a panther .\nNothing , however , appeared to be there .\nThen Dale studied the clouds driving across the sky , and he felt the cool dampness of a fine , misty rain on his face .\nIt would rain off and on during the night .\nWhereupon he entered the cabin .\nAnd the next moment he heard quick hoof-beats of trotting horses .\nPeering out , he saw dim , moving forms in the darkness , quite close at hand .\nThey had approached against the wind so that sound had been deadened .\nFive horses with riders , Dale made out -- saw them loom close .\nThen he heard rough voices .\nQuickly he turned to feel in the dark for a ladder he knew led to a loft ; and finding it , he quickly mounted , taking care not to make a noise with his rifle , and lay down upon the floor of brush and poles .\nScarcely had he done so when heavy steps , with accompaniment of clinking spurs , passed through the door below into the cabin .\n“ Wal , Beasley , are you here ? ” queried a loud voice .\nThere was no reply .\nThe man below growled under his breath , and again the spurs jingled .\n“ Fellars , Beasley ai n't here yet , ” he called .\n“ Put the hosses under the shed .\nWe 'll wait . ”\n“ Wait , huh ! ” came a harsh reply .\n“ Mebbe all night -- an ' we got nuthin ' to eat . ”\n“ Shut up , Moze .\nReckon you 're no good for anythin ' but eatin ' .\nPut them hosses away an ' some of you rustle fire-wood in here . ”\nLow , muttered curses , then mingled with dull thuds of hoofs and strain of leather and heaves of tired horses .\nAnother shuffling , clinking footstep entered the cabin .\n“ Snake , it 'd been sense to fetch a pack along , ” drawled this newcomer .\n“ Reckon so , Jim .\nBut we did n't , an ' what 's the use hollerin ' ?\nBeasley wo n't keep us waitin ' long . ”\nDale , lying still and prone , felt a slow start in all his blood -- a thrilling wave .\nThat deep-voiced man below was Snake Anson , the worst and most dangerous character of the region ; and the others , undoubtedly , composed his gang , long notorious in that sparsely settled country .\nAnd the Beasley mentioned -- he was one of the two biggest ranchers and sheep-raisers of the White Mountain ranges .\nWhat was the meaning of a rendezvous between Snake Anson and Beasley ?\nMilt Dale answered that question to Beasley 's discredit ; and many strange matters pertaining to sheep and herders , always a mystery to the little village of Pine , now became as clear as daylight .\nOther men entered the cabin .\n“ It ai n't a-goin ' to rain much , ” said one .\nThen came a crash of wood thrown to the ground .\n“ Jim , hyar 's a chunk of pine log , dry as punk , ” said another .\nRustlings and slow footsteps , and then heavy thuds attested to the probability that Jim was knocking the end of a log upon the ground to split off a corner whereby a handful of dry splinters could be procured .\n“ Snake , lem me your pipe , an ' I 'll hev a fire in a jiffy . ”\n“ Wal , I want my terbacco an ' I ai n't carin ' about no fire , ” replied Snake .\n“ Reckon you 're the meanest cuss in these woods , ” drawled Jim .\nSharp click of steel on flint -- many times -- and then a sound of hard blowing and sputtering told of Jim 's efforts to start a fire .\nPresently the pitchy blackness of the cabin changed ; there came a little crackling of wood and the rustle of flame , and then a steady growing roar .\nAs it chanced , Dale lay face down upon the floor of the loft , and right near his eyes there were cracks between the boughs .\nWhen the fire blazed up he was fairly well able to see the men below .\nThe only one he had ever seen was Jim Wilson , who had been well known at Pine before Snake Anson had ever been heard of .\nJim was the best of a bad lot , and he had friends among the honest people .\nIt was rumored that he and Snake did not pull well together .\n“ Fire feels good , ” said the burly Moze , who appeared as broad as he was black-visaged .\n“ Fall 's sure a-comin ' ... Now if only we had some grub ! ”\n“ Moze , there 's a hunk of deer meat in my saddle-bag , an ' if you git it you can have half , ” spoke up another voice .\nMoze shuffled out with alacrity .\nIn the firelight Snake Anson 's face looked lean and serpent-like , his eyes glittered , and his long neck and all of his long length carried out the analogy of his name .\n“ Snake , what 's this here deal with Beasley ? ” inquired Jim .\n“ Reckon you 'll l'arn when I do , ” replied the leader .\nHe appeared tired and thoughtful .\n“ Ai n't we done away with enough of them poor greaser herders -- for nothin ' ? ” queried the youngest of the gang , a boy in years , whose hard , bitter lips and hungry eyes somehow set him apart from his comrades .\n“ You 're dead right , Burt -- an ' that 's my stand , ” replied the man who had sent Moze out .\n“ Snake , snow 'll be flyin ' round these woods before long , ” said Jim Wilson .\n“ Are we goin ' to winter down in the Tonto Basin or over on the Gila ? ”\n“ Reckon we 'll do some tall ridin ' before we strike south , ” replied Snake , gruffly .\nAt the juncture Moze returned .\n“ Boss , I heerd a hoss comin ' up the trail , ” he said .\nSnake rose and stood at the door , listening .\nOutside the wind moaned fitfully and scattering raindrops pattered upon the cabin .\n“ A-huh ! ” exclaimed Snake , in relief .\nSilence ensued then for a moment , at the end of which interval Dale heard a rapid clip-clop on the rocky trail outside .\nThe men below shuffled uneasily , but none of them spoke .\nThe fire cracked cheerily .\nSnake Anson stepped back from before the door with an action that expressed both doubt and caution .\nThe trotting horse had halted out there somewhere .\n“ Ho there , inside ! ” called a voice from the darkness .\n“ Ho yourself ! ” replied Anson .\n“ That you , Snake ? ” quickly followed the query .\n“ Reckon so , ” returned Anson , showing himself .\nThe newcomer entered .\nHe was a large man , wearing a slicker that shone wet in the firelight .\nHis sombrero , pulled well down , shadowed his face , so that the upper half of his features might as well have been masked .\nHe had a black , drooping mustache , and a chin like a rock .\nA potential force , matured and powerful , seemed to be wrapped in his movements .\n“ Hullo , Snake !\nHullo , Wilson ! ” he said .\n“ I 've backed out on the other deal .\nSent for you on -- on another little matter ... particular private . ”\nHere he indicated with a significant gesture that Snake 's men were to leave the cabin .\n“ A-huh !\nejaculated Anson , dubiously .\nThen he turned abruptly .\nMoze , you an ' Shady an ' Burt go wait outside .\nReckon this ai n't the deal I expected ... .\nAn ' you can saddle the hosses . ”\n",

    "CHAPTER 1 The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses , and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden , there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac , or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn .\nFrom the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying , smoking , as was his custom , innumerable cigarettes , Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum , whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window , producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect , and making him think of those pallid , jade-faced painters of Tokyo who , through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile , seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion .\nThe sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass , or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine , seemed to make the stillness more oppressive .\nThe dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ .\nIn the centre of the room , clamped to an upright easel , stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty , and in front of it , some little distance away , was sitting the artist himself , Basil Hallward , whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused , at the time , such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures .\nAs the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art , a smile of pleasure passed across his face , and seemed about to linger there .\nBut he suddenly started up , and closing his eyes , placed his fingers upon the lids , as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake .\n\" It is your best work , Basil , the best thing you have ever done , \" said Lord Henry languidly .\n\" You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor .\nThe Academy is too large and too vulgar .\nWhenever I have gone there , there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures , which was dreadful , or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people , which was worse .\nThe Grosvenor is really the only place . \"\n\" I do n't think I shall send it anywhere , \" he answered , tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford .\n\" No , I wo n't send it anywhere . \"\nLord Henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy , opium-tainted cigarette .\n\" Not send it anywhere ?\nMy dear fellow , why ?\nHave you any reason ?\nWhat odd chaps you painters are !\nYou do anything in the world to gain a reputation .\nAs soon as you have one , you seem to want to throw it away .\nIt is silly of you , for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about , and that is not being talked about .\nA portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England , and make the old men quite jealous , if old men are ever capable of any emotion . \"\n\" I know you will laugh at me , \" he replied , \" but I really ca n't exhibit it .\nI have put too much of myself into it . \"\nLord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed .\n\" Yes , I knew you would ; but it is quite true , all the same . \"\n\" Too much of yourself in it !\nUpon my word , Basil , I did n't know you were so vain ; and I really ca n't see any resemblance between you , with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair , and this young Adonis , who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves .\nWhy , my dear Basil , he is a Narcissus , and you -- well , of course you have an intellectual expression and all that .\nBut beauty , real beauty , ends where an intellectual expression begins .\nIntellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration , and destroys the harmony of any face .\nThe moment one sits down to think , one becomes all nose , or all forehead , or something horrid .\nLook at the successful men in any of the learned professions .\nHow perfectly hideous they are !\nExcept , of course , in the Church .\nBut then in the Church they do n't think .\nA bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen , and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful .\nYour mysterious young friend , whose name you have never told me , but whose picture really fascinates me , never thinks .\nI feel quite sure of that .\nHe is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at , and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence .\nDo n't flatter yourself , Basil : you are not in the least like him . \"\n\" You do n't understand me , Harry , \" answered the artist .\n\" Of course I am not like him .\nI know that perfectly well .\nIndeed , I should be sorry to look like him .\nYou shrug your shoulders ?\nI am telling you the truth .\nThere is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction , the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings .\nIt is better not to be different from one 's fellows .\nThe ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world .\nThey can sit at their ease and gape at the play .\nIf they know nothing of victory , they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat .\nThey live as we all should live -- undisturbed , indifferent , and without disquiet .\nThey neither bring ruin upon others , nor ever receive it from alien hands .\nYour rank and wealth , Harry ; my brains , such as they are -- my art , whatever it may be worth ; Dorian Gray 's good looks -- we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us , suffer terribly . \"\n\" Dorian Gray ?\nIs that his name ? \"\nasked Lord Henry , walking across the studio towards Basil Hallward .\n\" Yes , that is his name .\nI did n't intend to tell it to you . \"\n\" But why not ? \"\n\" Oh , I ca n't explain .\nWhen I like people immensely , I never tell their names to any one .\nIt is like surrendering a part of them .\nI have grown to love secrecy .\nIt seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us .\nThe commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it .\nWhen I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going .\nIf I did , I would lose all my pleasure .\nIt is a silly habit , I dare say , but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one 's life .\nI suppose you think me awfully foolish about it ? \"\n\" Not at all , \" answered Lord Henry , \" not at all , my dear Basil .\nYou seem to forget that I am married , and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties .\nI never know where my wife is , and my wife never knows what I am doing .\nWhen we meet -- we do meet occasionally , when we dine out together , or go down to the Duke 's -- we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces .\nMy wife is very good at it -- much better , in fact , than I am .\nShe never gets confused over her dates , and I always do .\nBut when she does find me out , she makes no row at all .\nI sometimes wish she would ; but she merely laughs at me . \"\n\" I hate the way you talk about your married life , Harry , \" said Basil Hallward , strolling towards the door that led into the garden .\n\" I believe that you are really a very good husband , but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues .\nYou are an extraordinary fellow .\nYou never say a moral thing , and you never do a wrong thing .\nYour cynicism is simply a pose . \"\n\" Being natural is simply a pose , and the most irritating pose I know , \" cried Lord Henry , laughing ; and the two young men went out into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush .\nThe sunlight slipped over the polished leaves .\nIn the grass , white daisies were tremulous .\nAfter a pause , Lord Henry pulled out his watch .\n\" I am afraid I must be going , Basil , \" he murmured , \" and before I go , I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago . \"\n\" What is that ? \"\nsaid the painter , keeping his eyes fixed on the ground .\n\" You know quite well . \"\n\" I do not , Harry . \"\n\" Well , I will tell you what it is .\nI want you to explain to me why you wo n't exhibit Dorian Gray 's picture .\nI want the real reason . \"\n\" I told you the real reason . \"\n\" No , you did not .\nYou said it was because there was too much of yourself in it .\nNow , that is childish . \"\n\" Harry , \" said Basil Hallward , looking him straight in the face , \" every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist , not of the sitter .\nThe sitter is merely the accident , the occasion .\nIt is not he who is revealed by the painter ; it is rather the painter who , on the coloured canvas , reveals himself .\nThe reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul . \"\nLord Henry laughed .\n\" And what is that ? \"\nhe asked .\n\" I will tell you , \" said Hallward ; but an expression of perplexity came over his face .\n",

    "CHAPTER I I TAKE A COUNTRY HOUSE This is the story of how a middle-aged spinster lost her mind , deserted her domestic gods in the city , took a furnished house for the summer out of town , and found herself involved in one of those mysterious crimes that keep our newspapers and detective agencies happy and prosperous .\nFor twenty years I had been perfectly comfortable ; for twenty years I had had the window-boxes filled in the spring , the carpets lifted , the awnings put up and the furniture covered with brown linen ; for as many summers I had said good-by to my friends , and , after watching their perspiring hegira , had settled down to a delicious quiet in town , where the mail comes three times a day , and the water supply does not depend on a tank on the roof .\nAnd then -- the madness seized me .\nWhen I look back over the months I spent at Sunnyside , I wonder that I survived at all .\nAs it is , I show the wear and tear of my harrowing experiences .\nI have turned very gray -- Liddy reminded me of it , only yesterday , by saying that a little bluing in the rinse-water would make my hair silvery , instead of a yellowish white .\nI hate to be reminded of unpleasant things and I snapped her off .\n\" No , \" I said sharply , \" I 'm not going to use bluing at my time of life , or starch , either . \"\nLiddy 's nerves are gone , she says , since that awful summer , but she has enough left , goodness knows !\nAnd when she begins to go around with a lump in her throat , all I have to do is to threaten to return to Sunnyside , and she is frightened into a semblance of cheerfulness , -- from which you may judge that the summer there was anything but a success .\nThe newspaper accounts have been so garbled and incomplete -- one of them mentioned me but once , and then only as the tenant at the time the thing happened -- that I feel it my due to tell what I know .\nMr. Jamieson , the detective , said himself he could never have done without me , although he gave me little enough credit , in print .\nI shall have to go back several years -- thirteen , to be exact -- to start my story .\nAt that time my brother died , leaving me his two children .\nHalsey was eleven then , and Gertrude was seven .\nAll the responsibilities of maternity were thrust upon me suddenly ; to perfect the profession of motherhood requires precisely as many years as the child has lived , like the man who started to carry the calf and ended by walking along with the bull on his shoulders .\nHowever , I did the best I could .\nWhen Gertrude got past the hair-ribbon age , and Halsey asked for a scarf-pin and put on long trousers -- and a wonderful help that was to the darning .\n-- I sent them away to good schools .\nAfter that , my responsibility was chiefly postal , with three months every summer in which to replenish their wardrobes , look over their lists of acquaintances , and generally to take my foster-motherhood out of its nine months ' retirement in camphor .\nI missed the summers with them when , somewhat later , at boarding-school and college , the children spent much of their vacations with friends .\nGradually I found that my name signed to a check was even more welcome than when signed to a letter , though I wrote them at stated intervals .\nBut when Halsey had finished his electrical course and Gertrude her boarding-school , and both came home to stay , things were suddenly changed .\nThe winter Gertrude came out was nothing but a succession of sitting up late at night to bring her home from things , taking her to the dressmakers between naps the next day , and discouraging ineligible youths with either more money than brains , or more brains than money .\nAlso , I acquired a great many things : to say lingerie for under-garments , \" frocks \" and \" gowns \" instead of dresses , and that beardless sophomores are not college boys , but college men .\nHalsey required less personal supervision , and as they both got their mother 's fortune that winter , my responsibility became purely moral .\nHalsey bought a car , of course , and I learned how to tie over my bonnet a gray baize veil , and , after a time , never to stop to look at the dogs one has run down .\nPeople are apt to be so unpleasant about their dogs .\nThe additions to my education made me a properly equipped maiden aunt , and by spring I was quite tractable .\nSo when Halsey suggested camping in the Adirondacks and Gertrude wanted Bar Harbor , we compromised on a good country house with links near , within motor distance of town and telephone distance of the doctor .\nThat was how we went to Sunnyside .\nWe went out to inspect the property , and it seemed to deserve its name .\nIts cheerful appearance gave no indication whatever of anything out of the ordinary .\nOnly one thing seemed unusual to me : the housekeeper , who had been left in charge , had moved from the house to the gardener 's lodge , a few days before .\nAs the lodge was far enough away from the house , it seemed to me that either fire or thieves could complete their work of destruction undisturbed .\nThe property was an extensive one : the house on the top of a hill , which sloped away in great stretches of green lawn and clipped hedges , to the road ; and across the valley , perhaps a couple of miles away , was the Greenwood Club House .\nGertrude and Halsey were infatuated .\n\" Why , it 's everything you want , \" Halsey said \" View , air , good water and good roads .\nAs for the house , it 's big enough for a hospital , if it has a Queen Anne front and a Mary Anne back , \" which was ridiculous : it was pure Elizabethan .\nOf course we took the place ; it was not my idea of comfort , being much too large and sufficiently isolated to make the servant question serious .\nBut I give myself credit for this : whatever has happened since , I never blamed Halsey and Gertrude for taking me there .\nAnd another thing : if the series of catastrophes there did nothing else , it taught me one thing -- that somehow , somewhere , from perhaps a half-civilized ancestor who wore a sheepskin garment and trailed his food or his prey , I have in me the instinct of the chase .\nWere I a man I should be a trapper of criminals , trailing them as relentlessly as no doubt my sheepskin ancestor did his wild boar .\nBut being an unmarried woman , with the handicap of my sex , my first acquaintance with crime will probably be my last .\nIndeed , it came near enough to being my last acquaintance with anything .\nThe property was owned by Paul Armstrong , the president of the Traders ' Bank , who at the time we took the house was in the west with his wife and daughter , and a Doctor Walker , the Armstrong family physician .\nHalsey knew Louise Armstrong , -- had been rather attentive to her the winter before , but as Halsey was always attentive to somebody , I had not thought of it seriously , although she was a charming girl .\nI knew of Mr. Armstrong only through his connection with the bank , where the children 's money was largely invested , and through an ugly story about the son , Arnold Armstrong , who was reported to have forged his father 's name , for a considerable amount , to some bank paper .\nHowever , the story had had no interest for me .\nI cleared Halsey and Gertrude away to a house party , and moved out to Sunnyside the first of May .\nThe roads were bad , but the trees were in leaf , and there were still tulips in the borders around the house .\nThe arbutus was fragrant in the woods under the dead leaves , and on the way from the station , a short mile , while the car stuck in the mud , I found a bank showered with tiny forget-me-nots .\nThe birds -- do n't ask me what kind ; they all look alike to me , unless they have a hall mark of some bright color -- the birds were chirping in the hedges , and everything breathed of peace .\nLiddy , who was born and bred on a brick pavement , got a little bit down-spirited when the crickets began to chirp , or scrape their legs together , or whatever it is they do , at twilight .\nThe first night passed quietly enough .\nI have always been grateful for that one night 's peace ; it shows what the country might be , under favorable circumstances .\nNever after that night did I put my head on my pillow with any assurance how long it would be there ; or on my shoulders , for that matter .\nOn the following morning Liddy and Mrs. Ralston , my own housekeeper , had a difference of opinion , and Mrs. Ralston left on the eleven train .\nJust after luncheon , Burke , the butler , was taken unexpectedly with a pain in his right side , much worse when I was within hearing distance , and by afternoon he was started cityward .\nThat night the cook 's sister had a baby -- the cook , seeing indecision in my face , made it twins on second thought -- and , to be short , by noon the next day the household staff was down to Liddy and myself .\nAnd this in a house with twenty-two rooms and five baths !\nLiddy wanted to go back to the city at once , but the milk-boy said that Thomas Johnson , the Armstrongs ' colored butler , was working as a waiter at the Greenwood Club , and might come back .\nI have the usual scruples about coercing people 's servants away , but few of us have any conscience regarding institutions or corporations -- witness the way we beat railroads and street-car companies when we can -- so I called up the club , and about eight o'clock Thomas Johnson came to see me .\nPoor Thomas !\nWell , it ended by my engaging Thomas on the spot , at outrageous wages , and with permission to sleep in the gardener 's lodge , empty since the house was rented .\nThe old man -- he was white-haired and a little stooped , but with an immense idea of his personal dignity -- gave me his reasons hesitatingly .\n\" I ai n't sayin ' nothin ' , Mis ' Innes , \" he said , with his hand on the door-knob , \" but there 's been goin 's - on here this las ' few months as ai n't natchal .\n' Tai n't one thing an ' ' tai n't another -- it 's jest a door squealin ' here , an ' a winder closin ' there , but when doors an ' winders gets to cuttin ' up capers and there 's nobody nigh 'em , it 's time Thomas Johnson sleeps somewhar 's else . \"\n",

    "CHAPTER 1 .\nI AM BORN Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life , or whether that station will be held by anybody else , these pages must show .\nTo begin my life with the beginning of my life , I record that I was born ( as I have been informed and believe ) on a Friday , at twelve o’clock at night .\nIt was remarked that the clock began to strike , and I began to cry , simultaneously .\nIn consideration of the day and hour of my birth , it was declared by the nurse , and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted , first , that I was destined to be unlucky in life ; and secondly , that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits ; both these gifts inevitably attaching , as they believed , to all unlucky infants of either gender , born towards the small hours on a Friday night .\nI need say nothing here , on the first head , because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result .\nOn the second branch of the question , I will only remark , that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still a baby , I have not come into it yet .\nBut I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property ; and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it , he is heartily welcome to keep it .\nI was born with a caul , which was advertised for sale , in the newspapers , at the low price of fifteen guineas .\nWhether sea-going people were short of money about that time , or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets , I do n’t know ; all I know is , that there was but one solitary bidding , and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business , who offered two pounds in cash , and the balance in sherry , but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain .\nConsequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss -- for as to sherry , my poor dear mother ’s own sherry was in the market then -- and ten years afterwards , the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country , to fifty members at half-a-crown a head , the winner to spend five shillings .\nI was present myself , and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused , at a part of myself being disposed of in that way .\nThe caul was won , I recollect , by an old lady with a hand-basket , who , very reluctantly , produced from it the stipulated five shillings , all in halfpence , and twopence halfpenny short -- as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic , to endeavour without any effect to prove to her .\nIt is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there , that she was never drowned , but died triumphantly in bed , at ninety-two .\nI have understood that it was , to the last , her proudest boast , that she never had been on the water in her life , except upon a bridge ; and that over her tea ( to which she was extremely partial ) she , to the last , expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others , who had the presumption to go ‘ meandering ’ about the world .\nIt was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences , tea perhaps included , resulted from this objectionable practice .\nShe always returned , with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection , ‘ Let us have no meandering . ’\nNot to meander myself , at present , I will go back to my birth .\nI was born at Blunderstone , in Suffolk , or ‘ there by ’ , as they say in Scotland .\nI was a posthumous child .\nMy father ’s eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months , when mine opened on it .\nThere is something strange to me , even now , in the reflection that he never saw me ; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the churchyard , and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night , when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle , and the doors of our house were -- almost cruelly , it seemed to me sometimes -- bolted and locked against it .\nAn aunt of my father ’s , and consequently a great-aunt of mine , of whom I shall have more to relate by and by , was the principal magnate of our family .\nMiss Trotwood , or Miss Betsey , as my poor mother always called her , when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all ( which was seldom ) , had been married to a husband younger than herself , who was very handsome , except in the sense of the homely adage , ‘ handsome is , that handsome does ’ -- for he was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey , and even of having once , on a disputed question of supplies , made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs ’ window .\nThese evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him off , and effect a separation by mutual consent .\nHe went to India with his capital , and there , according to a wild legend in our family , he was once seen riding on an elephant , in company with a Baboon ; but I think it must have been a Baboo -- or a Begum .\nAnyhow , from India tidings of his death reached home , within ten years .\nHow they affected my aunt , nobody knew ; for immediately upon the separation , she took her maiden name again , bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off , established herself there as a single woman with one servant , and was understood to live secluded , ever afterwards , in an inflexible retirement .\nMy father had once been a favourite of hers , I believe ; but she was mortally affronted by his marriage , on the ground that my mother was ‘ a wax doll ’ .\nShe had never seen my mother , but she knew her to be not yet twenty .\nMy father and Miss Betsey never met again .\nHe was double my mother ’s age when he married , and of but a delicate constitution .\nHe died a year afterwards , and , as I have said , six months before I came into the world .\nThis was the state of matters , on the afternoon of , what I may be excused for calling , that eventful and important Friday .\nI can make no claim therefore to have known , at that time , how matters stood ; or to have any remembrance , founded on the evidence of my own senses , of what follows .\nMy mother was sitting by the fire , but poorly in health , and very low in spirits , looking at it through her tears , and desponding heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger , who was already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins , in a drawer upstairs , to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival ; my mother , I say , was sitting by the fire , that bright , windy March afternoon , very timid and sad , and very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her , when , lifting her eyes as she dried them , to the window opposite , she saw a strange lady coming up the garden .\nMy mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance , that it was Miss Betsey .\nThe setting sun was glowing on the strange lady , over the garden-fence , and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else .\nWhen she reached the house , she gave another proof of her identity .\nMy father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary Christian ; and now , instead of ringing the bell , she came and looked in at that identical window , pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent , that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment .\nShe gave my mother such a turn , that I have always been convinced I am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday .\nMy mother had left her chair in her agitation , and gone behind it in the corner .\nMiss Betsey , looking round the room , slowly and inquiringly , began on the other side , and carried her eyes on , like a Saracen ’s Head in a Dutch clock , until they reached my mother .\nThen she made a frown and a gesture to my mother , like one who was accustomed to be obeyed , to come and open the door .\nMy mother went .\n‘ Mrs. David Copperfield , I think , ’ said Miss Betsey ; the emphasis referring , perhaps , to my mother ’s mourning weeds , and her condition .\n‘ Yes , ’ said my mother , faintly .\n‘ Miss Trotwood , ’ said the visitor .\n‘ You have heard of her , I dare say ? ’\nMy mother answered she had had that pleasure .\nAnd she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure .\n‘ Now you see her , ’ said Miss Betsey .\nMy mother bent her head , and begged her to walk in .\nThey went into the parlour my mother had come from , the fire in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted -- not having been lighted , indeed , since my father ’s funeral ; and when they were both seated , and Miss Betsey said nothing , my mother , after vainly trying to restrain herself , began to cry .\n‘ Oh tut , tut , tut ! ’\nsaid Miss Betsey , in a hurry .\n‘ Do n’t do that !\nCome , come ! ’\nMy mother could n’t help it notwithstanding , so she cried until she had had her cry out .\n‘ Take off your cap , child , ’ said Miss Betsey , ‘ and let me see you . ’\nMy mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request , if she had any disposition to do so .\nTherefore she did as she was told , and did it with such nervous hands that her hair ( which was luxuriant and beautiful ) fell all about her face .\n‘",

    "Chapter 1 It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune , must be in want of a wife .\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood , this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families , that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters .\n“ My dear Mr. Bennet , ” said his lady to him one day , “ have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last ? ”\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not .\n“ But it is , ” returned she ; “ for Mrs. Long has just been here , and she told me all about it . ”\nMr. Bennet made no answer .\n“ Do you not want to know who has taken it ? ”\ncried his wife impatiently .\n“ _ You _ want to tell me , and I have no objection to hearing it . ”\nThis was invitation enough .\n“ Why , my dear , you must know , Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England ; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place , and was so much delighted with it , that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately ; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas , and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week . ”\n“ What is his name ? ”\n“ Bingley . ”\n“ Is he married or single ? ”\n“ Oh !\nSingle , my dear , to be sure !\nA single man of large fortune ; four or five thousand a year .\nWhat a fine thing for our girls ! ”\n“ How so ?\nHow can it affect them ? ”\n“ My dear Mr. Bennet , ” replied his wife , “ how can you be so tiresome !\nYou must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them . ”\n“ Is that his design in settling here ? ”\n“ Design !\nNonsense , how can you talk so !\nBut it is very likely that he _ may _ fall in love with one of them , and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes . ”\n“ I see no occasion for that .\nYou and the girls may go , or you may send them by themselves , which perhaps will be still better , for as you are as handsome as any of them , Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party . ”\n“ My dear , you flatter me .\nI certainly _ have _ had my share of beauty , but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now .\nWhen a woman has five grown-up daughters , she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty . ”\n“ In such cases , a woman has not often much beauty to think of . ”\n“ But , my dear , you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood . ”\n“ It is more than I engage for , I assure you . ”\n“ But consider your daughters .\nOnly think what an establishment it would be for one of them .\nSir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go , merely on that account , for in general , you know , they visit no newcomers .\nIndeed you must go , for it will be impossible for _ us _ to visit him if you do not . ”\n“ You are over-scrupulous , surely .\nI dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you ; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls ; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy . ”\n“ I desire you will do no such thing .\nLizzy is not a bit better than the others ; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane , nor half so good-humoured as Lydia .\nBut you are always giving _ her _ the preference . ”\n“ They have none of them much to recommend them , ” replied he ; “ they are all silly and ignorant like other girls ; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters . ”\n“ Mr. Bennet , how _ can _ you abuse your own children in such a way ?\nYou take delight in vexing me .\nYou have no compassion for my poor nerves . ”\n“ You mistake me , my dear .\nI have a high respect for your nerves .\nThey are my old friends .\nI have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least . ”\n“ Ah , you do not know what I suffer . ”\n“ But I hope you will get over it , and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood . ”\n“ It will be no use to us , if twenty such should come , since you will not visit them . ”\n“ Depend upon it , my dear , that when there are twenty , I will visit them all . ”\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts , sarcastic humour , reserve , and caprice , that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character .\n_ Her _ mind was less difficult to develop .\nShe was a woman of mean understanding , little information , and uncertain temper .\nWhen she was discontented , she fancied herself nervous .\nThe business of her life was to get her daughters married ; its solace was visiting and news .\nChapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley .\nHe had always intended to visit him , though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go ; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it .\nIt was then disclosed in the following manner .\nObserving his second daughter employed in trimming a hat , he suddenly addressed her with : “ I hope Mr. Bingley will like it , Lizzy . ”\n“ We are not in a way to know _ what _ Mr. Bingley likes , ” said her mother resentfully , “ since we are not to visit . ”\n“ But you forget , mamma , ” said Elizabeth , “ that we shall meet him at the assemblies , and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him . ”\n“ I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing .\nShe has two nieces of her own .\nShe is a selfish , hypocritical woman , and I have no opinion of her . ”\n“ No more have I , ” said Mr. Bennet ; “ and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you . ”\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply , but , unable to contain herself , began scolding one of her daughters .\n“ Do n't keep coughing so , Kitty , for Heaven 's sake !\nHave a little compassion on my nerves .\nYou tear them to pieces . ”\n“ Kitty has no discretion in her coughs , ” said her father ; “ she times them ill . ”\n“ I do not cough for my own amusement , ” replied Kitty fretfully .\n“ When is your next ball to be , Lizzy ? ”\n“ To-morrow fortnight . ”\n“ Aye , so it is , ” cried her mother , “ and Mrs. Long does not come back till the day before ; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him , for she will not know him herself . ”\n“ Then , my dear , you may have the advantage of your friend , and introduce Mr. Bingley to _ her _ . ”\n“ Impossible , Mr. Bennet , impossible , when I am not acquainted with him myself ; how can you be so teasing ? ”\n“ I honour your circumspection .\nA fortnight 's acquaintance is certainly very little .\nOne can not know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight .\nBut if _ we _ do not venture somebody else will ; and after all , Mrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance ; and , therefore , as she will think it an act of kindness , if you decline the office , I will take it on myself . ”\nThe girls stared at their father .\nMrs. Bennet said only , “ Nonsense , nonsense ! ”\n“ What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation ? ”\ncried he .\n“ Do you consider the forms of introduction , and the stress that is laid on them , as nonsense ?\nI can not quite agree with you _ there _ .\nWhat say you , Mary ?\nFor you are a young lady of deep reflection , I know , and read great books and make extracts . ”\nMary wished to say something sensible , but knew not how .\n“ While Mary is adjusting her ideas , ” he continued , “ let us return to Mr. Bingley . ”\n“ I am sick of Mr. Bingley , ” cried his wife .\n“ I am sorry to hear _ that _ ; but why did not you tell me that before ?\nIf I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him .\nIt is very unlucky ; but as I have actually paid the visit , we can not escape the acquaintance now . ”\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished ; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest ; though , when the first tumult of joy was over , she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while .\n“ How good it was in you , my dear Mr. Bennet !\nBut I knew I should persuade you at last .\nI was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance .\nWell , how pleased I am !\nand it is such a good joke , too , that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now . ”\n“ Now , Kitty , you may cough as much as you choose , ” said Mr. Bennet ; and , as he spoke , he left the room , fatigued with the raptures of his wife .\n“ What an excellent father you have , girls ! ”\nsaid she , when the door was shut .\n“ I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness ; or me , either , for that matter .\nAt our time of life it is not so pleasant , I can tell you , to be making new acquaintances every day ; but for your sakes , we would do anything .\nLydia , my love , though you _ are _ the youngest , I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball . ”\n",

    "A cloudy day : do you know what that is in a town of iron-works ?\nThe sky sank down before dawn , muddy , flat , immovable .\nThe air is thick , clammy with the breath of crowded human beings .\nIt stifles me .\nI open the window , and , looking out , can scarcely see through the rain the grocer 's shop opposite , where a crowd of drunken Irishmen are puffing Lynchburg tobacco in their pipes .\nI can detect the scent through all the foul smells ranging loose in the air .\nThe idiosyncrasy of this town is smoke .\nIt rolls sullenly in slow folds from the great chimneys of the iron-foundries , and settles down in black , slimy pools on the muddy streets .\nSmoke on the wharves , smoke on the dingy boats , on the yellow river , -- clinging in a coating of greasy soot to the house-front , the two faded poplars , the faces of the passers-by .\nThe long train of mules , dragging masses of pig-iron through the narrow street , have a foul vapor hanging to their reeking sides .\nHere , inside , is a little broken figure of an angel pointing upward from the mantel-shelf ; but even its wings are covered with smoke , clotted and black .\nSmoke everywhere !\nA dirty canary chirps desolately in a cage beside me .\nIts dream of green fields and sunshine is a very old dream , -- almost worn out , I think .\nFrom the back-window I can see a narrow brick-yard sloping down to the river-side , strewed with rain-butts and tubs .\nThe river , dull and tawny-colored , ( la belle riviere ! )\ndrags itself sluggishly along , tired of the heavy weight of boats and coal-barges .\nWhat wonder ?\nWhen I was a child , I used to fancy a look of weary , dumb appeal upon the face of the negro-like river slavishly bearing its burden day after day .\nSomething of the same idle notion comes to me to-day , when from the street-window I look on the slow stream of human life creeping past , night and morning , to the great mills .\nMasses of men , with dull , besotted faces bent to the ground , sharpened here and there by pain or cunning ; skin and muscle and flesh begrimed with smoke and ashes ; stooping all night over boiling caldrons of metal , laired by day in dens of drunkenness and infamy ; breathing from infancy to death an air saturated with fog and grease and soot , vileness for soul and body .\nWhat do you make of a case like that , amateur psychologist ?\nYou call it an altogether serious thing to be alive : to these men it is a drunken jest , a joke , -- horrible to angels perhaps , to them commonplace enough .\nMy fancy about the river was an idle one : it is no type of such a life .\nWhat if it be stagnant and slimy here ?\nIt knows that beyond there waits for it odorous sunlight , quaint old gardens , dusky with soft , green foliage of apple-trees , and flushing crimson with roses , -- air , and fields , and mountains .\nThe future of the Welsh puddler passing just now is not so pleasant .\nTo be stowed away , after his grimy work is done , in a hole in the muddy graveyard , and after that , not air , nor green fields , nor curious roses .\nCan you see how foggy the day is ?\nAs I stand here , idly tapping the windowpane , and looking out through the rain at the dirty back-yard and the coalboats below , fragments of an old story float up before me , -- a story of this house into which I happened to come to-day .\nYou may think it a tiresome story enough , as foggy as the day , sharpened by no sudden flashes of pain or pleasure .\n-- I know : only the outline of a dull life , that long since , with thousands of dull lives like its own , was vainly lived and lost : thousands of them , massed , vile , slimy lives , like those of the torpid lizards in yonder stagnant water-butt .\n-- Lost ?\nThere is a curious point for you to settle , my friend , who study psychology in a lazy , dilettante way .\nStop a moment .\nI am going to be honest .\nThis is what I want you to do .\nI want you to hide your disgust , take no heed to your clean clothes , and come right down with me , -- here , into the thickest of the fog and mud and foul effluvia .\nI want you to hear this story .\nThere is a secret down here , in this nightmare fog , that has lain dumb for centuries : I want to make it a real thing to you .\nYou , Egoist , or Pantheist , or Arminian , busy in making straight paths for your feet on the hills , do not see it clearly , -- this terrible question which men here have gone mad and died trying to answer .\nI dare not put this secret into words .\nI told you it was dumb .\nThese men , going by with drunken faces and brains full of unawakened power , do not ask it of Society or of God .\nTheir lives ask it ; their deaths ask it .\nThere is no reply .\nI will tell you plainly that I have a great hope ; and I bring it to you to be tested .\nIt is this : that this terrible dumb question is its own reply ; that it is not the sentence of death we think it , but , from the very extremity of its darkness , the most solemn prophecy which the world has known of the Hope to come .\nI dare make my meaning no clearer , but will only tell my story .\nIt will , perhaps , seem to you as foul and dark as this thick vapor about us , and as pregnant with death ; but if your eyes are free as mine are to look deeper , no perfume-tinted dawn will be so fair with promise of the day that shall surely come .\nMy story is very simple , -- Only what I remember of the life of one of these men , -- a furnace-tender in one of Kirby & John 's rolling-mills , -- Hugh Wolfe .\nYou know the mills ?\nThey took the great order for the lower Virginia railroads there last winter ; run usually with about a thousand men .\nI can not tell why I choose the half-forgotten story of this Wolfe more than that of myriads of these furnace-hands .\nPerhaps because there is a secret , underlying sympathy between that story and this day with its impure fog and thwarted sunshine , -- or perhaps simply for the reason that this house is the one where the Wolfes lived .\nThere were the father and son , -- both hands , as I said , in one of Kirby & John 's mills for making railroad-iron , -- and Deborah , their cousin , a picker in some of the cotton-mills .\nThe house was rented then to half a dozen families .\nThe Wolfes had two of the cellar-rooms .\nThe old man , like many of the puddlers and feeders of the mills , was Welsh , -- had spent half of his life in the Cornish tin-mines .\nYou may pick the Welsh emigrants , Cornish miners , out of the throng passing the windows , any day .\nThey are a trifle more filthy ; their muscles are not so brawny ; they stoop more .\nWhen they are drunk , they neither yell , nor shout , nor stagger , but skulk along like beaten hounds .\nA pure , unmixed blood , I fancy : shows itself in the slight angular bodies and sharply-cut facial lines .\nIt is nearly thirty years since the Wolfes lived here .\nTheir lives were like those of their class : incessant labor , sleeping in kennel-like rooms , eating rank pork and molasses , drinking -- God and the distillers only know what ; with an occasional night in jail , to atone for some drunken excess .\nIs that all of their lives ?\n-- of the portion given to them and these their duplicates swarming the streets to-day ?\n-- nothing beneath ?\n-- all ?\nSo many a political reformer will tell you , -- and many a private reformer , too , who has gone among them with a heart tender with Christ 's charity , and come out outraged , hardened .\nOne rainy night , about eleven o'clock , a crowd of half-clothed women stopped outside of the cellar-door .\nThey were going home from the cotton-mill .\n“ Good-night , Deb , ” said one , a mulatto , steadying herself against the gas-post .\nShe needed the post to steady her .\nSo did more than one of them .\n“ Dah 's a ball to Miss Potts ' to-night .\nYe 'd best come . ”\n“ Inteet , Deb , if hur 'll come , hur 'll hef fun , ” said a shrill Welsh voice in the crowd .\nTwo or three dirty hands were thrust out to catch the gown of the woman , who was groping for the latch of the door .\n“ No . ”\n“ No ?\nWhere 's Kit Small , then ? ”\n“ Begorra !\non the spools .\nAlleys behint , though we helped her , we dud .\nAn wid ye !\nLet Deb alone !\nIt 's ondacent frettin ' a quite body .\nBe the powers , an we 'll have a night of it !\nthere 'll be lashin 's o ' drink , -- the Vargent be blessed and praised for ' t ! ”\nThey went on , the mulatto inclining for a moment to show fight , and drag the woman Wolfe off with them ; but , being pacified , she staggered away .\nDeborah groped her way into the cellar , and , after considerable stumbling , kindled a match , and lighted a tallow dip , that sent a yellow glimmer over the room .\nIt was low , damp , -- the earthen floor covered with a green , slimy moss , -- a fetid air smothering the breath .\nOld Wolfe lay asleep on a heap of straw , wrapped in a torn horse-blanket .\nHe was a pale , meek little man , with a white face and red rabbit-eyes .\nThe woman Deborah was like him ; only her face was even more ghastly , her lips bluer , her eyes more watery .\nShe wore a faded cotton gown and a slouching bonnet .\nWhen she walked , one could see that she was deformed , almost a hunchback .\nShe trod softly , so as not to waken him , and went through into the room beyond .\nThere she found by the half-extinguished fire an iron saucepan filled with cold boiled potatoes , which she put upon a broken chair with a pint-cup of ale .\nPlacing the old candlestick beside this dainty repast , she untied her bonnet , which hung limp and wet over her face , and prepared to eat her supper .\nIt was the first food that had touched her lips since morning .\nThere was enough of it , however : there is not always .\nShe was hungry , -- one could see that easily enough , -- and not drunk , as most of her companions would have been found at this hour .\nShe did not drink , this woman , -- her face told that , too , -- nothing stronger than ale .\nPerhaps the weak , flaccid wretch had some stimulant in her pale life to keep her up , -- some love or hope , it might be , or urgent need .\nWhen that stimulant was gone , she would take to whiskey .\nMan can not live by work alone .\nWhile she was skinning the potatoes , and munching them , a noise behind her made her stop .\n",

    "I The Old Pyncheon Family HALFWAY down a by-street of one of our New England towns stands a rusty wooden house , with seven acutely peaked gables , facing towards various points of the compass , and a huge , clustered chimney in the midst .\nThe street is Pyncheon Street ; the house is the old Pyncheon House ; and an elm-tree , of wide circumference , rooted before the door , is familiar to every town-born child by the title of the Pyncheon Elm .\nOn my occasional visits to the town aforesaid , I seldom failed to turn down Pyncheon Street , for the sake of passing through the shadow of these two antiquities , -- the great elm-tree and the weather-beaten edifice .\nThe aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human countenance , bearing the traces not merely of outward storm and sunshine , but expressive also , of the long lapse of mortal life , and accompanying vicissitudes that have passed within .\nWere these to be worthily recounted , they would form a narrative of no small interest and instruction , and possessing , moreover , a certain remarkable unity , which might almost seem the result of artistic arrangement .\nBut the story would include a chain of events extending over the better part of two centuries , and , written out with reasonable amplitude , would fill a bigger folio volume , or a longer series of duodecimos , than could prudently be appropriated to the annals of all New England during a similar period .\nIt consequently becomes imperative to make short work with most of the traditionary lore of which the old Pyncheon House , otherwise known as the House of the Seven Gables , has been the theme .\nWith a brief sketch , therefore , of the circumstances amid which the foundation of the house was laid , and a rapid glimpse at its quaint exterior , as it grew black in the prevalent east wind , -- pointing , too , here and there , at some spot of more verdant mossiness on its roof and walls , -- we shall commence the real action of our tale at an epoch not very remote from the present day .\nStill , there will be a connection with the long past -- a reference to forgotten events and personages , and to manners , feelings , and opinions , almost or wholly obsolete -- which , if adequately translated to the reader , would serve to illustrate how much of old material goes to make up the freshest novelty of human life .\nHence , too , might be drawn a weighty lesson from the little-regarded truth , that the act of the passing generation is the germ which may and must produce good or evil fruit in a far-distant time ; that , together with the seed of the merely temporary crop , which mortals term expediency , they inevitably sow the acorns of a more enduring growth , which may darkly overshadow their posterity .\nThe House of the Seven Gables , antique as it now looks , was not the first habitation erected by civilized man on precisely the same spot of ground .\nPyncheon Street formerly bore the humbler appellation of Maule 's Lane , from the name of the original occupant of the soil , before whose cottage-door it was a cow-path .\nA natural spring of soft and pleasant water -- a rare treasure on the sea-girt peninsula where the Puritan settlement was made -- had early induced Matthew Maule to build a hut , shaggy with thatch , at this point , although somewhat too remote from what was then the centre of the village .\nIn the growth of the town , however , after some thirty or forty years , the site covered by this rude hovel had become exceedingly desirable in the eyes of a prominent and powerful personage , who asserted plausible claims to the proprietorship of this and a large adjacent tract of land , on the strength of a grant from the legislature .\nColonel Pyncheon , the claimant , as we gather from whatever traits of him are preserved , was characterized by an iron energy of purpose .\nMatthew Maule , on the other hand , though an obscure man , was stubborn in the defence of what he considered his right ; and , for several years , he succeeded in protecting the acre or two of earth which , with his own toil , he had hewn out of the primeval forest , to be his garden ground and homestead .\nNo written record of this dispute is known to be in existence .\nOur acquaintance with the whole subject is derived chiefly from tradition .\nIt would be bold , therefore , and possibly unjust , to venture a decisive opinion as to its merits ; although it appears to have been at least a matter of doubt , whether Colonel Pyncheon 's claim were not unduly stretched , in order to make it cover the small metes and bounds of Matthew Maule .\nWhat greatly strengthens such a suspicion is the fact that this controversy between two ill-matched antagonists -- at a period , moreover , laud it as we may , when personal influence had far more weight than now -- remained for years undecided , and came to a close only with the death of the party occupying the disputed soil .\nThe mode of his death , too , affects the mind differently , in our day , from what it did a century and a half ago .\nIt was a death that blasted with strange horror the humble name of the dweller in the cottage , and made it seem almost a religious act to drive the plough over the little area of his habitation , and obliterate his place and memory from among men .\nOld Matthew Maule , in a word , was executed for the crime of witchcraft .\nHe was one of the martyrs to that terrible delusion , which should teach us , among its other morals , that the influential classes , and those who take upon themselves to be leaders of the people , are fully liable to all the passionate error that has ever characterized the maddest mob .\nClergymen , judges , statesmen , -- the wisest , calmest , holiest persons of their day stood in the inner circle round about the gallows , loudest to applaud the work of blood , latest to confess themselves miserably deceived .\nIf any one part of their proceedings can be said to deserve less blame than another , it was the singular indiscrimination with which they persecuted , not merely the poor and aged , as in former judicial massacres , but people of all ranks ; their own equals , brethren , and wives .\nAmid the disorder of such various ruin , it is not strange that a man of inconsiderable note , like Maule , should have trodden the martyr 's path to the hill of execution almost unremarked in the throng of his fellow sufferers .\nBut , in after days , when the frenzy of that hideous epoch had subsided , it was remembered how loudly Colonel Pyncheon had joined in the general cry , to purge the land from witchcraft ; nor did it fail to be whispered , that there was an invidious acrimony in the zeal with which he had sought the condemnation of Matthew Maule .\nIt was well known that the victim had recognized the bitterness of personal enmity in his persecutor 's conduct towards him , and that he declared himself hunted to death for his spoil .\nAt the moment of execution -- with the halter about his neck , and while Colonel Pyncheon sat on horseback , grimly gazing at the scene Maule had addressed him from the scaffold , and uttered a prophecy , of which history , as well as fireside tradition , has preserved the very words .\n\" God , \" said the dying man , pointing his finger , with a ghastly look , at the undismayed countenance of his enemy , -- \" God will give him blood to drink ! \"\nAfter the reputed wizard 's death , his humble homestead had fallen an easy spoil into Colonel Pyncheon 's grasp .\nWhen it was understood , however , that the Colonel intended to erect a family mansion-spacious , ponderously framed of oaken timber , and calculated to endure for many generations of his posterity over the spot first covered by the log-built hut of Matthew Maule , there was much shaking of the head among the village gossips .\nWithout absolutely expressing a doubt whether the stalwart Puritan had acted as a man of conscience and integrity throughout the proceedings which have been sketched , they , nevertheless , hinted that he was about to build his house over an unquiet grave .\nHis home would include the home of the dead and buried wizard , and would thus afford the ghost of the latter a kind of privilege to haunt its new apartments , and the chambers into which future bridegrooms were to lead their brides , and where children of the Pyncheon blood were to be born .\nThe terror and ugliness of Maule 's crime , and the wretchedness of his punishment , would darken the freshly plastered walls , and infect them early with the scent of an old and melancholy house .\nWhy , then , -- while so much of the soil around him was bestrewn with the virgin forest leaves , -- why should Colonel Pyncheon prefer a site that had already been accurst ?\nBut the Puritan soldier and magistrate was not a man to be turned aside from his well-considered scheme , either by dread of the wizard 's ghost , or by flimsy sentimentalities of any kind , however specious .\nHad he been told of a bad air , it might have moved him somewhat ; but he was ready to encounter an evil spirit on his own ground .\nEndowed with commonsense , as massive and hard as blocks of granite , fastened together by stern rigidity of purpose , as with iron clamps , he followed out his original design , probably without so much as imagining an objection to it .\nOn the score of delicacy , or any scrupulousness which a finer sensibility might have taught him , the Colonel , like most of his breed and generation , was impenetrable .\nHe therefore dug his cellar , and laid the deep foundations of his mansion , on the square of earth whence Matthew Maule , forty years before , had first swept away the fallen leaves .\nIt was a curious , and , as some people thought , an ominous fact , that , very soon after the workmen began their operations , the spring of water , above mentioned , entirely lost the deliciousness of its pristine quality .\nWhether its sources were disturbed by the depth of the new cellar , or whatever subtler cause might lurk at the bottom , it is certain that the water of Maule 's Well , as it continued to be called , grew hard and brackish .\nEven such we find it now ; and any old woman of the neighborhood will certify that it is productive of intestinal mischief to those who quench their thirst there .\nThe reader may deem it singular that the head carpenter of the new edifice was no other than the son of the very man from whose dead gripe the property of the soil had been wrested .\nNot improbably he was the best workman of his time ; or , perhaps , the Colonel thought it expedient , or was impelled by some better feeling , thus openly to cast aside all animosity against the race of his fallen antagonist .\nNor was it out of keeping with the general coarseness and matter-of-fact character of the age , that the son should be willing to earn an honest penny , or , rather , a weighty amount of sterling pounds , from the purse of his father 's deadly enemy .\nAt all events , Thomas Maule became the architect of the House of the Seven Gables , and performed his duty so faithfully that the timber framework fastened by his hands still holds together .\n",

    "CHAPTER I IN WHICH I THROW AMBS-ACE THE work of the day being over , I sat down upon my doorstep , pipe in hand , to rest awhile in the cool of the evening .\nDeath is not more still than is this Virginian land in the hour when the sun has sunk away , and it is black beneath the trees , and the stars brighten slowly and softly , one by one .\nThe birds that sing all day have hushed , and the horned owls , the monster frogs , and that strange and ominous fowl ( if fowl it be , and not , as some assert , a spirit damned ) which we English call the whippoorwill , are yet silent .\nLater the wolf will howl and the panther scream , but now there is no sound .\nThe winds are laid , and the restless leaves droop and are quiet .\nThe low lap of the water among the reeds is like the breathing of one who sleeps in his watch beside the dead .\nI marked the light die from the broad bosom of the river , leaving it a dead man 's hue .\nAwhile ago , and for many evenings , it had been crimson , -- a river of blood .\nA week before , a great meteor had shot through the night , blood-red and bearded , drawing a slow-fading fiery trail across the heavens ; and the moon had risen that same night blood-red , and upon its disk there was drawn in shadow a thing most marvelously like a scalping knife .\nWherefore , the following day being Sunday , good Mr. Stockham , our minister at Weyanoke , exhorted us to be on our guard , and in his prayer besought that no sedition or rebellion might raise its head amongst the Indian subjects of the Lord 's anointed .\nAfterward , in the churchyard , between the services , the more timorous began to tell of divers portents which they had observed , and to recount old tales of how the savages distressed us in the Starving Time .\nThe bolder spirits laughed them to scorn , but the women began to weep and cower , and I , though I laughed too , thought of Smith , and how he ever held the savages , and more especially that Opechancanough who was now their emperor , in a most deep distrust ; telling us that the red men watched while we slept , that they might teach wiliness to a Jesuit , and how to bide its time to a cat crouched before a mousehole .\nI thought of the terms we now kept with these heathen ; of how they came and went familiarly amongst us , spying out our weakness , and losing the salutary awe which that noblest captain had struck into their souls ; of how many were employed as hunters to bring down deer for lazy masters ; of how , breaking the law , and that not secretly , we gave them knives and arms , a soldier 's bread , in exchange for pelts and pearls ; of how their emperor was forever sending us smooth messages ; of how their lips smiled and their eyes frowned .\nThat afternoon , as I rode home through the lengthening shadows , a hunter , red-brown and naked , rose from behind a fallen tree that sprawled across my path , and made offer to bring me my meat from the moon of corn to the moon of stags in exchange for a gun .\nThere was scant love between the savages and myself , -- it was answer enough when I told him my name .\nI left the dark figure standing , still as a carved stone , in the heavy shadow of the trees , and , spurring my horse ( sent me from home , the year before , by my cousin Percy ) , was soon at my house , -- a poor and rude one , but pleasantly set upon a slope of green turf , and girt with maize and the broad leaves of the tobacco .\nWhen I had had my supper , I called from their hut the two Paspahegh lads bought by me from their tribe the Michaelmas before , and soundly flogged them both , having in my mind a saying of my ancient captain 's , namely , “ He who strikes first oft-times strikes last . ”\nUpon the afternoon of which I now speak , in the midsummer of the year of grace 1621 , as I sat upon my doorstep , my long pipe between my teeth and my eyes upon the pallid stream below , my thoughts were busy with these matters , -- so busy that I did not see a horse and rider emerge from the dimness of the forest into the cleared space before my palisade , nor knew , until his voice came up the bank , that my good friend , Master John Rolfe , was without and would speak to me .\nI went down to the gate , and , unbarring it , gave him my hand and led the horse within the inclosure .\n“ Thou careful man ! ” he said , with a laugh , as he dismounted .\n“ Who else , think you , in this or any other hundred , now bars his gate when the sun goes down ? ”\n“ It is my sunset gun , ” I answered briefly , fastening his horse as I spoke .\nHe put his arm about my shoulder , for we were old friends , and together we went up the green bank to the house , and , when I had brought him a pipe , sat down side by side upon the doorstep .\n“ Of what were you dreaming ? ” he asked presently , when we had made for ourselves a great cloud of smoke .\n“ I called you twice . ”\n“ I was wishing for Dale 's times and Dale 's laws . ”\nHe laughed , and touched my knee with his hand , white and smooth as a woman 's , and with a green jewel upon the forefinger .\n“ Thou Mars incarnate ! ” he cried .\n“ Thou first , last , and in the meantime soldier !\nWhy , what wilt thou do when thou gettest to heaven ?\nMake it too hot to hold thee ?\nOr take out letters of marque against the Enemy ? ”\n“ I am not there yet , ” I said dryly .\n“ In the meantime I would like a commission against -- your relatives . ”\nHe laughed , then sighed , and , sinking his chin into his hand and softly tapping his foot against the ground , fell into a reverie .\n“ I would your princess were alive , ” I said presently .\n“ So do I , ” he answered softly .\n“ So do I. ” Locking his hands behind his head , he raised his quiet face to the evening star .\n“ Brave and wise and gentle , ” he mused .\n“ If I did not think to meet her again , beyond that star , I could not smile and speak calmly , Ralph , as I do now . ”\n“ ' T is a strange thing , ” I said , as I refilled my pipe .\n“ Love for your brother-in-arms , love for your commander if he be a commander worth having , love for your horse and dog , I understand .\nBut wedded love !\nto tie a burden around one 's neck because ' t is pink and white , or clear bronze , and shaped with elegance !\nFaugh ! ”\n“ Yet I came with half a mind to persuade thee to that very burden ! ” he cried , with another laugh .\n“ Thanks for thy pains , ” I said , blowing blue rings into the air .\n“ I have ridden to-day from Jamestown , ” he went on .\n“ I was the only man , i ' faith , that cared to leave its gates ; and I met the world -- the bachelor world -- flocking to them .\nNot a mile of the way but I encountered Tom , Dick , and Harry , dressed in their Sunday bravery and making full tilt for the city .\nAnd the boats upon the river !\nI have seen the Thames less crowded . ”\n“ There was more passing than usual , ” I said ; “ but I was busy in the fields , and did not attend .\nWhat 's the lodestar ? ”\n“ The star that draws us all , -- some to ruin , some to bliss ineffable , woman . ”\n“ Humph !\nThe maids have come , then ? ”\nHe nodded .\n“ There 's a goodly ship down there , with a goodly lading . ”\n“ Videlicet , some fourscore waiting damsels and milkmaids , warranted honest by my Lord Warwick , ” I muttered .\n“ This business hath been of Edwyn Sandys ' management , as you very well know , ” he rejoined , with some heat .\n“ His word is good : therefore I hold them chaste .\nThat they are fair I can testify , having seen them leave the ship . ”\n“ Fair and chaste , ” I said , “ but meanly born . ”\n“ I grant you that , ” he answered .\n“ But after all , what of it ?\nBeggars must not be choosers .\nThe land is new and must be peopled , nor will those who come after us look too curiously into the lineage of those to whom a nation owes its birth .\nWhat we in these plantations need is a loosening of the bonds which tie us to home , to England , and a tightening of those which bind us to this land in which we have cast our lot .\nWe put our hand to the plough , but we turn our heads and look to our Egypt and its fleshpots . '\nT is children and wife -- be that wife princess or peasant -- that make home of a desert , that bind a man with chains of gold to the country where they abide .\nWherefore , when at midday I met good Master Wickham rowing down from Henricus to Jamestown , to offer his aid to Master Bucke in his press of business to-morrow , I gave the good man Godspeed , and thought his a fruitful errand and one pleasing to the Lord . ”\n“ Amen , ” I yawned .\n“ I love the land , and call it home .\nMy withers are unwrung . ”\nHe rose to his feet , and began to pace the greensward before the door .\nMy eyes followed his trim figure , richly though sombrely clad , then fell with a sudden dissatisfaction upon my own stained and frayed apparel .\n“ Ralph , ” he said presently , coming to a stand before me , “ have you ever an hundred and twenty pounds of tobacco in hand ?\nIf not , I ” -- “ I have the weed , ” I replied .\n“ What then ? ”\n“ Then at dawn drop down with the tide to the city , and secure for thyself one of these same errant damsels . ”\n",

    "CHAPTER 1 .\nA Not Unnatural Enterprise This is written from memory , unfortunately .\nIf I could have brought with me the material I so carefully prepared , this would be a very different story .\nWhole books full of notes , carefully copied records , firsthand descriptions , and the pictures -- that ’s the worst loss .\nWe had some bird ’s - eyes of the cities and parks ; a lot of lovely views of streets , of buildings , outside and in , and some of those gorgeous gardens , and , most important of all , of the women themselves .\nNobody will ever believe how they looked .\nDescriptions are n’t any good when it comes to women , and I never was good at descriptions anyhow .\nBut it ’s got to be done somehow ; the rest of the world needs to know about that country .\nI have n’t said where it was for fear some self-appointed missionaries , or traders , or land-greedy expansionists , will take it upon themselves to push in .\nThey will not be wanted , I can tell them that , and will fare worse than we did if they do find it .\nIt began this way .\nThere were three of us , classmates and friends -- Terry O. Nicholson ( we used to call him the Old Nick , with good reason ) , Jeff Margrave , and I , Vandyck Jennings .\nWe had known each other years and years , and in spite of our differences we had a good deal in common .\nAll of us were interested in science .\nTerry was rich enough to do as he pleased .\nHis great aim was exploration .\nHe used to make all kinds of a row because there was nothing left to explore now , only patchwork and filling in , he said .\nHe filled in well enough -- he had a lot of talents -- great on mechanics and electricity .\nHad all kinds of boats and motorcars , and was one of the best of our airmen .\nWe never could have done the thing at all without Terry .\nJeff Margrave was born to be a poet , a botanist -- or both -- but his folks persuaded him to be a doctor instead .\nHe was a good one , for his age , but his real interest was in what he loved to call “ the wonders of science . ”\nAs for me , sociology ’s my major .\nYou have to back that up with a lot of other sciences , of course .\nI ’m interested in them all .\nTerry was strong on facts -- geography and meteorology and those ; Jeff could beat him any time on biology , and I did n’t care what it was they talked about , so long as it connected with human life , somehow .\nThere are few things that do n’t .\nWe three had a chance to join a big scientific expedition .\nThey needed a doctor , and that gave Jeff an excuse for dropping his just opening practice ; they needed Terry ’s experience , his machine , and his money ; and as for me , I got in through Terry ’s influence .\nThe expedition was up among the thousand tributaries and enormous hinterland of a great river , up where the maps had to be made , savage dialects studied , and all manner of strange flora and fauna expected .\nBut this story is not about that expedition .\nThat was only the merest starter for ours .\nMy interest was first roused by talk among our guides .\nI ’m quick at languages , know a good many , and pick them up readily .\nWhat with that and a really good interpreter we took with us , I made out quite a few legends and folk myths of these scattered tribes .\nAnd as we got farther and farther upstream , in a dark tangle of rivers , lakes , morasses , and dense forests , with here and there an unexpected long spur running out from the big mountains beyond , I noticed that more and more of these savages had a story about a strange and terrible Woman Land in the high distance .\n“ Up yonder , ” “ Over there , ” “ Way up ” -- was all the direction they could offer , but their legends all agreed on the main point -- that there was this strange country where no men lived -- only women and girl children .\nNone of them had ever seen it .\nIt was dangerous , deadly , they said , for any man to go there .\nBut there were tales of long ago , when some brave investigator had seen it -- a Big Country , Big Houses , Plenty People -- All Women .\nHad no one else gone ?\nYes -- a good many -- but they never came back .\nIt was no place for men -- of that they seemed sure .\nI told the boys about these stories , and they laughed at them .\nNaturally I did myself .\nI knew the stuff that savage dreams are made of .\nBut when we had reached our farthest point , just the day before we all had to turn around and start for home again , as the best of expeditions must in time , we three made a discovery .\nThe main encampment was on a spit of land running out into the main stream , or what we thought was the main stream .\nIt had the same muddy color we had been seeing for weeks past , the same taste .\nI happened to speak of that river to our last guide , a rather superior fellow with quick , bright eyes .\nHe told me that there was another river -- “ over there , short river , sweet water , red and blue . ”\nI was interested in this and anxious to see if I had understood , so I showed him a red and blue pencil I carried , and asked again .\nYes , he pointed to the river , and then to the southwestward .\n“ River -- good water -- red and blue . ”\nTerry was close by and interested in the fellow ’s pointing .\n“ What does he say , Van ? ”\nI told him .\nTerry blazed up at once .\n“ Ask him how far it is . ”\nThe man indicated a short journey ; I judged about two hours , maybe three .\n“ Let ’s go , ” urged Terry .\n“ Just us three .\nMaybe we can really find something .\nMay be cinnabar in it . ”\n“ May be indigo , ” Jeff suggested , with his lazy smile .\nIt was early yet ; we had just breakfasted ; and leaving word that we ’d be back before night , we got away quietly , not wishing to be thought too gullible if we failed , and secretly hoping to have some nice little discovery all to ourselves .\nIt was a long two hours , nearer three .\nI fancy the savage could have done it alone much quicker .\nThere was a desperate tangle of wood and water and a swampy patch we never should have found our way across alone .\nBut there was one , and I could see Terry , with compass and notebook , marking directions and trying to place landmarks .\nWe came after a while to a sort of marshy lake , very big , so that the circling forest looked quite low and dim across it .\nOur guide told us that boats could go from there to our camp -- but “ long way -- all day . ”\nThis water was somewhat clearer than that we had left , but we could not judge well from the margin .\nWe skirted it for another half hour or so , the ground growing firmer as we advanced , and presently we turned the corner of a wooded promontory and saw a quite different country -- a sudden view of mountains , steep and bare .\n“ One of those long easterly spurs , ” Terry said appraisingly .\n“ May be hundreds of miles from the range .\nThey crop out like that . ”\nSuddenly we left the lake and struck directly toward the cliffs .\nWe heard running water before we reached it , and the guide pointed proudly to his river .\nIt was short .\nWe could see where it poured down a narrow vertical cataract from an opening in the face of the cliff .\nIt was sweet water .\nThe guide drank eagerly and so did we .\n“ That ’s snow water , ” Terry announced .\n“ Must come from way back in the hills . ”\nBut as to being red and blue -- it was greenish in tint .\nThe guide seemed not at all surprised .\nHe hunted about a little and showed us a quiet marginal pool where there were smears of red along the border ; yes , and of blue .\nTerry got out his magnifying glass and squatted down to investigate .\n“ Chemicals of some sort -- I ca n’t tell on the spot .\nLook to me like dyestuffs .\nLet ’s get nearer , ” he urged , “ up there by the fall . ”\nWe scrambled along the steep banks and got close to the pool that foamed and boiled beneath the falling water .\nHere we searched the border and found traces of color beyond dispute .\nMore -- Jeff suddenly held up an unlooked-for trophy .\nIt was only a rag , a long , raveled fragment of cloth .\nBut it was a well-woven fabric , with a pattern , and of a clear scarlet that the water had not faded .\nNo savage tribe that we had heard of made such fabrics .\nThe guide stood serenely on the bank , well pleased with our excitement .\n“ One day blue -- one day red -- one day green , ” he told us , and pulled from his pouch another strip of bright-hued cloth .\n“ Come down , ” he said , pointing to the cataract .\n“ Woman Country -- up there . ”\nThen we were interested .\nWe had our rest and lunch right there and pumped the man for further information .\nHe could tell us only what the others had -- a land of women -- no men -- babies , but all girls .\nNo place for men -- dangerous .\nSome had gone to see -- none had come back .\nI could see Terry ’s jaw set at that .\nNo place for men ?\nDangerous ?\nHe looked as if he might shin up the waterfall on the spot .\nBut the guide would not hear of going up , even if there had been any possible method of scaling that sheer cliff , and we had to get back to our party before night .\n“ They might stay if we told them , ” I suggested .\nBut Terry stopped in his tracks .\n“ Look here , fellows , ” he said .\n“ This is our find .\nLet ’s not tell those cocky old professors .\nLet ’s go on home with ‘ em , and then come back -- just us -- have a little expedition of our own . ”\n",

    "Chapter 1 One may as well begin with Helen 's letters to her sister .\nHOWARDS END , TUESDAY .\nDearest Meg , It is n't going to be what we expected .\nIt is old and little , and altogether delightful -- red brick .\nWe can scarcely pack in as it is , and the dear knows what will happen when Paul ( younger son ) arrives tomorrow .\nFrom hall you go right or left into dining-room or drawing-room .\nHall itself is practically a room .\nYou open another door in it , and there are the stairs going up in a sort of tunnel to the first-floor .\nThree bedrooms in a row there , and three attics in a row above .\nThat is n't all the house really , but it 's all that one notices -- nine windows as you look up from the front garden .\nThen there 's a very big wych-elm -- to the left as you look up -- leaning a little over the house , and standing on the boundary between the garden and meadow .\nI quite love that tree already .\nAlso ordinary elms , oaks -- no nastier than ordinary oaks -- pear-trees , apple-trees , and a vine .\nNo silver birches , though .\nHowever , I must get on to my host and hostess .\nI only wanted to show that it is n't the least what we expected .\nWhy did we settle that their house would be all gables and wiggles , and their garden all gamboge-coloured paths ?\nI believe simply because we associate them with expensive hotels -- Mrs. Wilcox trailing in beautiful dresses down long corridors , Mr. Wilcox bullying porters , etc .\nWe females are that unjust .\nI shall be back Saturday ; will let you know train later .\nThey are as angry as I am that you did not come too ; really Tibby is too tiresome , he starts a new mortal disease every month .\nHow could he have got hay fever in London ?\nand even if he could , it seems hard that you should give up a visit to hear a schoolboy sneeze .\nTell him that Charles Wilcox ( the son who is here ) has hay fever too , but he 's brave , and gets quite cross when we inquire after it .\nMen like the Wilcoxes would do Tibby a power of good .\nBut you wo n't agree , and I 'd better change the subject .\nThis long letter is because I 'm writing before breakfast .\nOh , the beautiful vine leaves !\nThe house is covered with a vine .\nI looked out earlier , and Mrs. Wilcox was already in the garden .\nShe evidently loves it .\nNo wonder she sometimes looks tired .\nShe was watching the large red poppies come out .\nThen she walked off the lawn to the meadow , whose corner to the right I can just see .\nTrail , trail , went her long dress over the sopping grass , and she came back with her hands full of the hay that was cut yesterday -- I suppose for rabbits or something , as she kept on smelling it .\nThe air here is delicious .\nLater on I heard the noise of croquet balls , and looked out again , and it was Charles Wilcox practising ; they are keen on all games .\nPresently he started sneezing and had to stop .\nThen I hear more clicketing , and it is Mr. Wilcox practising , and then , ' a-tissue , a-tissue ' : he has to stop too .\nThen Evie comes out , and does some calisthenic exercises on a machine that is tacked on to a greengage-tree -- they put everything to use -- and then she says ' a-tissue , ' and in she goes .\nAnd finally Mrs. Wilcox reappears , trail , trail , still smelling hay and looking at the flowers .\nI inflict all this on you because once you said that life is sometimes life and sometimes only a drama , and one must learn to distinguish t ' other from which , and up to now I have always put that down as ' Meg 's clever nonsense . '\nBut this morning , it really does seem not life but a play , and it did amuse me enormously to watch the W 's .\nNow Mrs. Wilcox has come in .\nI am going to wear [ omission ] .\nLast night Mrs. Wilcox wore an [ omission ] , and Evie [ omission ] .\nSo it is n't exactly a go-as-you-please place , and if you shut your eyes it still seems the wiggly hotel that we expected .\nNot if you open them .\nThe dog-roses are too sweet .\nThere is a great hedge of them over the lawn -- magnificently tall , so that they fall down in garlands , and nice and thin at the bottom , so that you can see ducks through it and a cow .\nThese belong to the farm , which is the only house near us .\nThere goes the breakfast gong .\nMuch love .\nModified love to Tibby .\nLove to Aunt Juley ; how good of her to come and keep you company , but what a bore .\nBurn this .\nWill write again Thursday .\nHelen HOWARDS END , FRIDAY .\nDearest Meg , I am having a glorious time .\nI like them all .\nMrs. Wilcox , if quieter than in Germany , is sweeter than ever , and I never saw anything like her steady unselfishness , and the best of it is that the others do not take advantage of her .\nThey are the very happiest , jolliest family that you can imagine .\nI do really feel that we are making friends .\nThe fun of it is that they think me a noodle , and say so -- at least Mr. Wilcox does -- and when that happens , and one does n't mind , it 's a pretty sure test , is n't it ?\nHe says the most horrid things about women 's suffrage so nicely , and when I said I believed in equality he just folded his arms and gave me such a setting down as I 've never had .\nMeg , shall we ever learn to talk less ?\nI never felt so ashamed of myself in my life .\nI could n't point to a time when men had been equal , nor even to a time when the wish to be equal had made them happier in other ways .\nI could n't say a word .\nI had just picked up the notion that equality is good from some book -- probably from poetry , or you .\nAnyhow , it 's been knocked into pieces , and , like all people who are really strong , Mr. Wilcox did it without hurting me .\nOn the other hand , I laugh at them for catching hay fever .\nWe live like fighting-cocks , and Charles takes us out every day in the motor -- a tomb with trees in it , a hermit 's house , a wonderful road that was made by the Kings of Mercia -- tennis -- a cricket match -- bridge -- and at night we squeeze up in this lovely house .\nThe whole clan 's here now -- it 's like a rabbit warren .\nEvie is a dear .\nThey want me to stop over Sunday -- I suppose it wo n't matter if I do .\nMarvellous weather and the view 's marvellous -- views westward to the high ground .\nThank you for your letter .\nBurn this .\nYour affectionate Helen HOWARDS END , SUNDAY .\nDearest , dearest Meg , -- I do not know what you will say : Paul and I are in love -- the younger son who only came here Wednesday .\nChapter 2 Margaret glanced at her sister 's note and pushed it over the breakfast-table to her aunt .\nThere was a moment 's hush , and then the flood-gates opened .\n\" I can tell you nothing , Aunt Juley .\nI know no more than you do .\nWe met -- we only met the father and mother abroad last spring .\nI know so little that I did n't even know their son 's name .\nIt 's all so -- \" She waved her hand and laughed a little .\n\" In that case it is far too sudden . \"\n\" Who knows , Aunt Juley , who knows ? \"\n\" But , Margaret dear , I mean we must n't be unpractical now that we 've come to facts .\nIt is too sudden , surely . \"\n\" Who knows ! \"\n\" But Margaret dear -- \" \" I 'll go for her other letters , \" said Margaret .\n\" No , I wo n't , I 'll finish my breakfast .\nIn fact , I have n't them .\nWe met the Wilcoxes on an awful expedition that we made from Heidelberg to Speyer .\nHelen and I had got it into our heads that there was a grand old cathedral at Speyer -- the Archbishop of Speyer was one of the seven electors -- you know -- ' Speyer , Maintz , and Koln . '\nThose three sees once commanded the Rhine Valley and got it the name of Priest Street . \"\n\" I still feel quite uneasy about this business , Margaret . \"\n\" The train crossed by a bridge of boats , and at first sight it looked quite fine .\nBut oh , in five minutes we had seen the whole thing .\nThe cathedral had been ruined , absolutely ruined , by restoration ; not an inch left of the original structure .\nWe wasted a whole day , and came across the Wilcoxes as we were eating our sandwiches in the public gardens .\nThey too , poor things , had been taken in -- they were actually stopping at Speyer -- and they rather liked Helen insisting that they must fly with us to Heidelberg .\nAs a matter of fact , they did come on next day .\nWe all took some drives together .\nThey knew us well enough to ask Helen to come and see them -- at least , I was asked too , but Tibby 's illness prevented me , so last Monday she went alone .\nThat 's all .\nYou know as much as I do now .\nIt 's a young man out the unknown .\nShe was to have come back Saturday , but put off till Monday , perhaps on account of -- I do n't know .\nShe broke off , and listened to the sounds of a London morning .\nTheir house was in Wickham Place , and fairly quiet , for a lofty promontory of buildings separated it from the main thoroughfare .\nOne had the sense of a backwater , or rather of an estuary , whose waters flowed in from the invisible sea , and ebbed into a profound silence while the waves without were still beating .\nThough the promontory consisted of flats -- expensive , with cavernous entrance halls , full of concierges and palms -- it fulfilled its purpose , and gained for the older houses opposite a certain measure of peace .\nThese , too , would be swept away in time , and another promontory would rise upon their site , as humanity piled itself higher and higher on the precious soil of London .\n",

    "CHAPTER I ' HASTE TO THE WEDDING ' ' Wooed and married and a ' . '\n' Edith ! '\nsaid Margaret , gently , ' Edith ! '\nBut , as Margaret half suspected , Edith had fallen asleep .\nShe lay curled up on the sofa in the back drawing-room in Harley Street , looking very lovely in her white muslin and blue ribbons .\nIf Titania had ever been dressed in white muslin and blue ribbons , and had fallen asleep on a crimson damask sofa in a back drawing-room , Edith might have been taken for her .\nMargaret was struck afresh by her cousin 's beauty .\nThey had grown up together from childhood , and all along Edith had been remarked upon by every one , except Margaret , for her prettiness ; but Margaret had never thought about it until the last few days , when the prospect of soon losing her companion seemed to give force to every sweet quality and charm which Edith possessed .\nThey had been talking about wedding dresses , and wedding ceremonies ; and Captain Lennox , and what he had told Edith about her future life at Corfu , where his regiment was stationed ; and the difficulty of keeping a piano in good tune ( a difficulty which Edith seemed to consider as one of the most formidable that could befall her in her married life ) , and what gowns she should want in the visits to Scotland , which would immediately succeed her marriage ; but the whispered tone had latterly become more drowsy ; and Margaret , after a pause of a few minutes , found , as she fancied , that in spite of the buzz in the next room , Edith had rolled herself up into a soft ball of muslin and ribbon , and silken curls , and gone off into a peaceful little after-dinner nap .\nMargaret had been on the point of telling her cousin of some of the plans and visions which she entertained as to her future life in the country parsonage , where her father and mother lived ; and where her bright holidays had always been passed , though for the last ten years her aunt Shaw 's house had been considered as her home .\nBut in default of a listener , she had to brood over the change in her life silently as heretofore .\nIt was a happy brooding , although tinged with regret at being separated for an indefinite time from her gentle aunt and dear cousin .\nAs she thought of the delight of filling the important post of only daughter in Helstone parsonage , pieces of the conversation out of the next room came upon her ears .\nHer aunt Shaw was talking to the five or six ladies who had been dining there , and whose husbands were still in the dining-room .\nThey were the familiar acquaintances of the house ; neighbours whom Mrs. Shaw called friends , because she happened to dine with them more frequently than with any other people , and because if she or Edith wanted anything from them , or they from her , they did not scruple to make a call at each other 's houses before luncheon .\nThese ladies and their husbands were invited , in their capacity of friends , to eat a farewell dinner in honour of Edith 's approaching marriage .\nEdith had rather objected to this arrangement , for Captain Lennox was expected to arrive by a late train this very evening ; but , although she was a spoiled child , she was too careless and idle to have a very strong will of her own , and gave way when she found that her mother had absolutely ordered those extra delicacies of the season which are always supposed to be efficacious against immoderate grief at farewell dinners .\nShe contented herself by leaning back in her chair , merely playing with the food on her plate , and looking grave and absent ; while all around her were enjoying the mots of Mr. Grey , the gentleman who always took the bottom of the table at Mrs. Shaw 's dinner parties , and asked Edith to give them some music in the drawing-room .\nMr. Grey was particularly agreeable over this farewell dinner , and the gentlemen staid down stairs longer than usual .\nIt was very well they did -- to judge from the fragments of conversation which Margaret overheard . '\nI suffered too much myself ; not that I was not extremely happy with the poor dear General , but still disparity of age is a drawback ; one that I was resolved Edith should not have to encounter .\nOf course , without any maternal partiality , I foresaw that the dear child was likely to marry early ; indeed , I had often said that I was sure she would be married before she was nineteen .\nI had quite a prophetic feeling when Captain Lennox ' -- and here the voice dropped into a whisper , but Margaret could easily supply the blank .\nThe course of true love in Edith 's case had run remarkably smooth .\nMrs. Shaw had given way to the presentiment , as she expressed it ; and had rather urged on the marriage , although it was below the expectations which many of Edith 's acquaintances had formed for her , a young and pretty heiress .\nBut Mrs. Shaw said that her only child should marry for love , -- and sighed emphatically , as if love had not been her motive for marrying the General .\nMrs. Shaw enjoyed the romance of the present engagement rather more than her daughter .\nNot but that Edith was very thoroughly and properly in love ; still she would certainly have preferred a good house in Belgravia , to all the picturesqueness of the life which Captain Lennox described at Corfu .\nThe very parts which made Margaret glow as she listened , Edith pretended to shiver and shudder at ; partly for the pleasure she had in being coaxed out of her dislike by her fond lover , and partly because anything of a gipsy or make-shift life was really distasteful to her .\nYet had any one come with a fine house , and a fine estate , and a fine title to boot , Edith would still have clung to Captain Lennox while the temptation lasted ; when it was over , it is possible she might have had little qualms of ill-concealed regret that Captain Lennox could not have united in his person everything that was desirable .\nIn this she was but her mother 's child ; who , after deliberately marrying General Shaw with no warmer feeling than respect for his character and establishment , was constantly , though quietly , bemoaning her hard lot in being united to one whom she could not love . '\nI have spared no expense in her trousseau , ' were the next words Margaret heard .\n' She has all the beautiful Indian shawls and scarfs the General gave to me , but which I shall never wear again . '\n' She is a lucky girl , ' replied another voice , which Margaret knew to be that of Mrs. Gibson , a lady who was taking a double interest in the conversation , from the fact of one of her daughters having been married within the last few weeks .\n' Helen had set her heart upon an Indian shawl , but really when I found what an extravagant price was asked , I was obliged to refuse her .\nShe will be quite envious when she hears of Edith having Indian shawls .\nWhat kind are they ?\nDelhi ?\nwith the lovely little borders ? '\nMargaret heard her aunt 's voice again , but this time it was as if she had raised herself up from her half-recumbent position , and were looking into the more dimly lighted back drawing-room .\n' Edith !\nEdith ! '\ncried she ; and then she sank as if wearied by the exertion .\nMargaret stepped forward .\n' Edith is asleep , Aunt Shaw .\nIs it anything I can do ? '\nAll the ladies said ' Poor child ! '\non receiving this distressing intelligence about Edith ; and the minute lap-dog in Mrs. Shaw 's arms began to bark , as if excited by the burst of pity .\n' Hush , Tiny !\nyou naughty little girl !\nyou will waken your mistress .\nIt was only to ask Edith if she would tell Newton to bring down her shawls : perhaps you would go , Margaret dear ? '\nMargaret went up into the old nursery at the very top of the house , where Newton was busy getting up some laces which were required for the wedding .\nWhile Newton went ( not without a muttered grumbling ) to undo the shawls , which had already been exhibited four or five times that day , Margaret looked round upon the nursery ; the first room in that house with which she had become familiar nine years ago , when she was brought , all untamed from the forest , to share the home , the play , and the lessons of her cousin Edith .\nShe remembered the dark , dim look of the London nursery , presided over by an austere and ceremonious nurse , who was terribly particular about clean hands and torn frocks .\nShe recollected the first tea up there -- separate from her father and aunt , who were dining somewhere down below an infinite depth of stairs ; for unless she were up in the sky ( the child thought ) , they must be deep down in the bowels of the earth .\nAt home -- before she came to live in Harley Street -- her mother 's dressing-room had been her nursery ; and , as they kept early hours in the country parsonage , Margaret had always had her meals with her father and mother .\nOh !\nwell did the tall stately girl of eighteen remember the tears shed with such wild passion of grief by the little girl of nine , as she hid her face under the bed-clothes , in that first night ; and how she was bidden not to cry by the nurse , because it would disturb Miss Edith ; and how she had cried as bitterly , but more quietly , till her newly-seen , grand , pretty aunt had come softly upstairs with Mr. Hale to show him his little sleeping daughter .\nThen the little Margaret had hushed her sobs , and tried to lie quiet as if asleep , for fear of making her father unhappy by her grief , which she dared not express before her aunt , and which she rather thought it was wrong to feel at all after the long hoping , and planning , and contriving they had gone through at home , before her wardrobe could be arranged so as to suit her grander circumstances , and before papa could leave his parish to come up to London , even for a few days .\nNow she had got to love the old nursery , though it was but a dismantled place ; and she looked all round , with a kind of cat-like regret , at the idea of leaving it for ever in three days .\n' Ah Newton ! '\nsaid she , ' I think we shall all be sorry to leave this dear old room . '\n",

    "CHAPTER I JONATHAN HARKER 'S JOURNAL ( _ Kept in shorthand .\n_ ) _ 3 May .\nBistritz .\n_ -- Left Munich at 8:35 P. M. , on 1st May , arriving at Vienna early next morning ; should have arrived at 6:46 , but train was an hour late .\nBuda-Pesth seems a wonderful place , from the glimpse which I got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the streets .\nI feared to go very far from the station , as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible .\nThe impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the East ; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube , which is here of noble width and depth , took us among the traditions of Turkish rule .\nWe left in pretty good time , and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh .\nHere I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale .\nI had for dinner , or rather supper , a chicken done up some way with red pepper , which was very good but thirsty .\n( _ Mem .\n_ , get recipe for Mina . )\nI asked the waiter , and he said it was called \" paprika hendl , \" and that , as it was a national dish , I should be able to get it anywhere along the Carpathians .\nI found my smattering of German very useful here ; indeed , I do n't know how I should be able to get on without it .\nHaving had some time at my disposal when in London , I had visited the British Museum , and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding Transylvania ; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country .\nI find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country , just on the borders of three states , Transylvania , Moldavia and Bukovina , in the midst of the Carpathian mountains ; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe .\nI was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the Castle Dracula , as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own Ordnance Survey maps ; but I found that Bistritz , the post town named by Count Dracula , is a fairly well-known place .\nI shall enter here some of my notes , as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my travels with Mina .\nIn the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities : Saxons in the South , and mixed with them the Wallachs , who are the descendants of the Dacians ; Magyars in the West , and Szekelys in the East and North .\nI am going among the latter , who claim to be descended from Attila and the Huns .\nThis may be so , for when the Magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it .\nI read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the Carpathians , as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool ; if so my stay may be very interesting .\n( _ Mem .\n_ , I must ask the Count all about them . )\nI did not sleep well , though my bed was comfortable enough , for I had all sorts of queer dreams .\nThere was a dog howling all night under my window , which may have had something to do with it ; or it may have been the paprika , for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe , and was still thirsty .\nTowards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door , so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then .\nI had for breakfast more paprika , and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was \" mamaliga , \" and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat , a very excellent dish , which they call \" impletata . \"\n( _ Mem .\n_ , get recipe for this also . )\nI had to hurry breakfast , for the train started a little before eight , or rather it ought to have done so , for after rushing to the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move .\nIt seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains .\nWhat ought they to be in China ?\nAll day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind .\nSometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals ; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods .\nIt takes a lot of water , and running strong , to sweep the outside edge of a river clear .\nAt every station there were groups of people , sometimes crowds , and in all sorts of attire .\nSome of them were just like the peasants at home or those I saw coming through France and Germany , with short jackets and round hats and home-made trousers ; but others were very picturesque .\nThe women looked pretty , except when you got near them , but they were very clumsy about the waist .\nThey had all full white sleeves of some kind or other , and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet , but of course there were petticoats under them .\nThe strangest figures we saw were the Slovaks , who were more barbarian than the rest , with their big cow-boy hats , great baggy dirty-white trousers , white linen shirts , and enormous heavy leather belts , nearly a foot wide , all studded over with brass nails .\nThey wore high boots , with their trousers tucked into them , and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches .\nThey are very picturesque , but do not look prepossessing .\nOn the stage they would be set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands .\nThey are , however , I am told , very harmless and rather wanting in natural self-assertion .\nIt was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz , which is a very interesting old place .\nBeing practically on the frontier -- for the Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina -- it has had a very stormy existence , and it certainly shows marks of it .\nFifty years ago a series of great fires took place , which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions .\nAt the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people , the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease .\nCount Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel , which I found , to my great delight , to be thoroughly old-fashioned , for of course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country .\nI was evidently expected , for when I got near the door I faced a cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress -- white undergarment with long double apron , front , and back , of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty .\nWhen I came close she bowed and said , \" The Herr Englishman ? \"\n\" Yes , \" I said , \" Jonathan Harker . \"\nShe smiled , and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves , who had followed her to the door .\nHe went , but immediately returned with a letter : -- \" My Friend .\n-- Welcome to the Carpathians .\nI am anxiously expecting you .\nSleep well to-night .\nAt three to-morrow the diligence will start for Bukovina ; a place on it is kept for you .\nAt the Borgo Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me .\nI trust that your journey from London has been a happy one , and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land .\n\" Your friend , \" DRACULA . \"\n_ 4 May .\n_ -- I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count , directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me ; but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent , and pretended that he could not understand my German .\nThis could not be true , because up to then he had understood it perfectly ; at least , he answered my questions exactly as if he did .\nHe and his wife , the old lady who had received me , looked at each other in a frightened sort of way .\nHe mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter , and that was all he knew .\nWhen I asked him if he knew Count Dracula , and could tell me anything of his castle , both he and his wife crossed themselves , and , saying that they knew nothing at all , simply refused to speak further .\nIt was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask any one else , for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting .\nJust before I was leaving , the old lady came up to my room and said in a very hysterical way : \" Must you go ?\nOh !\nyoung Herr , must you go ? \"\nShe was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew , and mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all .\nI was just able to follow her by asking many questions .\nWhen I told her that I must go at once , and that I was engaged on important business , she asked again : \" Do you know what day it is ? \"\nI answered that it was the fourth of May .\nShe shook her head as she said again : \" Oh , yes !\nI know that !\nI know that , but do you know what day it is ? \"\nOn my saying that I did not understand , she went on : \" It is the eve of St. George 's Day .\nDo you not know that to-night , when the clock strikes midnight , all the evil things in the world will have full sway ?\nDo you know where you are going , and what you are going to ? \"\nShe was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her , but without effect .\nFinally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go ; at least to wait a day or two before starting .\nIt was all very ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable .\nHowever , there was business to be done , and I could allow nothing to interfere with it .\nI therefore tried to raise her up , and said , as gravely as I could , that I thanked her , but my duty was imperative , and that I must go .\nShe then rose and dried her eyes , and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me .\nI did not know what to do , for , as an English Churchman , I have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous , and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind .\nShe saw , I suppose , the doubt in my face , for she put the rosary round my neck , and said , \" For your mother 's sake , \" and went out of the room .\nI am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting for the coach , which is , of course , late ; and the crucifix is still round my neck .\nWhether it is the old lady 's fear , or the many ghostly traditions of this place , or the crucifix itself , I do not know , but I am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual .\nIf this book should ever reach Mina before I do , let it bring my good-bye .\nHere comes the coach !\n",

    "Letter 1 St. Petersburgh , Dec. 11th , 17 -- TO Mrs. Saville , England You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings .\nI arrived here yesterday , and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking .\nI am already far north of London , and as I walk in the streets of Petersburgh , I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks , which braces my nerves and fills me with delight .\nDo you understand this feeling ?\nThis breeze , which has travelled from the regions towards which I am advancing , gives me a foretaste of those icy climes .\nInspirited by this wind of promise , my daydreams become more fervent and vivid .\nI try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation ; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight .\nThere , Margaret , the sun is forever visible , its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour .\nThere -- for with your leave , my sister , I will put some trust in preceding navigators -- there snow and frost are banished ; and , sailing over a calm sea , we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe .\nIts productions and features may be without example , as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes .\nWhat may not be expected in a country of eternal light ?\nI may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent forever .\nI shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited , and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man .\nThese are my enticements , and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat , with his holiday mates , on an expedition of discovery up his native river .\nBut supposing all these conjectures to be false , you can not contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all mankind , to the last generation , by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries , to reach which at present so many months are requisite ; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet , which , if at all possible , can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine .\nThese reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my letter , and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven , for nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose -- a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye .\nThis expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years .\nI have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean through the seas which surround the pole .\nYou may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good Uncle Thomas ' library .\nMy education was neglected , yet I was passionately fond of reading .\nThese volumes were my study day and night , and my familiarity with them increased that regret which I had felt , as a child , on learning that my father 's dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life .\nThese visions faded when I perused , for the first time , those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven .\nI also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation ; I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated .\nYou are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment .\nBut just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin , and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent .\nSix years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking .\nI can , even now , remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this great enterprise .\nI commenced by inuring my body to hardship .\nI accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea ; I voluntarily endured cold , famine , thirst , and want of sleep ; I often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics , the theory of medicine , and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage .\nTwice I actually hired myself as an under-mate in a Greenland whaler , and acquitted myself to admiration .\nI must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness , so valuable did he consider my services .\nAnd now , dear Margaret , do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose ?\nMy life might have been passed in ease and luxury , but I preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path .\nOh , that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative !\nMy courage and my resolution is firm ; but my hopes fluctuate , and my spirits are often depressed .\nI am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage , the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude : I am required not only to raise the spirits of others , but sometimes to sustain my own , when theirs are failing .\nThis is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia .\nThey fly quickly over the snow in their sledges ; the motion is pleasant , and , in my opinion , far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach .\nThe cold is not excessive , if you are wrapped in furs -- a dress which I have already adopted , for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours , when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins .\nI have no ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and Archangel .\nI shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks ; and my intention is to hire a ship there , which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner , and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing .\nI do not intend to sail until the month of June ; and when shall I return ?\nAh , dear sister , how can I answer this question ?\nIf I succeed , many , many months , perhaps years , will pass before you and I may meet .\nIf I fail , you will see me again soon , or never .\nFarewell , my dear , excellent Margaret .\nHeaven shower down blessings on you , and save me , that I may again and again testify my gratitude for all your love and kindness .\nYour affectionate brother , R. Walton Letter 2 Archangel , 28th March , 17 -- To Mrs. Saville , England How slowly the time passes here , encompassed as I am by frost and snow !\nYet a second step is taken towards my enterprise .\nI have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors ; those whom I have already engaged appear to be men on whom I can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage .\nBut I have one want which I have never yet been able to satisfy , and the absence of the object of which I now feel as a most severe evil , I have no friend , Margaret : when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success , there will be none to participate my joy ; if I am assailed by disappointment , no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection .\nI shall commit my thoughts to paper , it is true ; but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling .\nI desire the company of a man who could sympathize with me , whose eyes would reply to mine .\nYou may deem me romantic , my dear sister , but I bitterly feel the want of a friend .\nI have no one near me , gentle yet courageous , possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind , whose tastes are like my own , to approve or amend my plans .\nHow would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother !\nI am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties .\nBut it is a still greater evil to me that I am self-educated : for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomas ' books of voyages .\nAt that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country ; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country .\nNow I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen .\nIt is true that I have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent , but they want ( as the painters call it ) KEEPING ; and I greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic , and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind .\nWell , these are useless complaints ; I shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean , nor even here in Archangel , among merchants and seamen .\nYet some feelings , unallied to the dross of human nature , beat even in these rugged bosoms .\nMy lieutenant , for instance , is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise ; he is madly desirous of glory , or rather , to word my phrase more characteristically , of advancement in his profession .\nHe is an Englishman , and in the midst of national and professional prejudices , unsoftened by cultivation , retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity .\nI first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel ; finding that he was unemployed in this city , I easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise .\nThe master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline .\nThis circumstance , added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage , made me very desirous to engage him .\nA youth passed in solitude , my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage , has so refined the groundwork of my character that I can not overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship : I have never believed it to be necessary , and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew , I felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services .\nI heard of him first in rather a romantic manner , from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life .\nThis , briefly , is his story .\nSome years ago he loved a young Russian lady of moderate fortune , and having amassed a considerable sum in prize-money , the father of the girl consented to the match .\nHe saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony ; but she was bathed in tears , and throwing herself at his feet , entreated him to spare her , confessing at the same time that she loved another , but that he was poor , and that her father would never consent to the union .\nMy generous friend reassured the suppliant , and on being informed of the name of her lover , instantly abandoned his pursuit .\nHe had already bought a farm with his money , on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life ; but he bestowed the whole on his rival , together with the remains of his prize-money to purchase stock , and then himself solicited the young woman 's father to consent to her marriage with her lover .\nBut the old man decidedly refused , thinking himself bound in honour to my friend , who , when he found the father inexorable , quitted his country , nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations .\n\" What a noble fellow ! \"\nyou will exclaim .\nHe is so ; but then he is wholly uneducated : he is as silent as a Turk , and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him , which , while it renders his conduct the more astonishing , detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command .\n",

    "CHAPTER I THERE IS NO ONE LEFT When Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle everybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen .\nIt was true , too .\nShe had a little thin face and a little thin body , thin light hair and a sour expression .\nHer hair was yellow , and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another .\nHer father had held a position under the English Government and had always been busy and ill himself , and her mother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herself with gay people .\nShe had not wanted a little girl at all , and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah , who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible .\nSo when she was a sickly , fretful , ugly little baby she was kept out of the way , and when she became a sickly , fretful , toddling thing she was kept out of the way also .\nShe never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants , and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything , because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying , by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived .\nThe young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months , and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one .\nSo if Mary had not chosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all .\nOne frightfully hot morning , when she was about nine years old , she awakened feeling very cross , and she became crosser still when she saw that the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah .\n\" Why did you come ? \" she said to the strange woman .\n\" I will not let you stay .\nSend my Ayah to me . \"\nThe woman looked frightened , but she only stammered that the Ayah could not come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked her , she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not possible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib .\nThere was something mysterious in the air that morning .\nNothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing , while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces .\nBut no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come .\nShe was actually left alone as the morning went on , and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda .\nShe pretended that she was making a flower-bed , and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth , all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned .\n\" Pig !\nPig !\nDaughter of Pigs ! \" she said , because to call a native a pig is the worst insult of all .\nShe was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one .\nShe was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices .\nMary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy .\nShe had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England .\nThe child stared at him , but she stared most at her mother .\nShe always did this when she had a chance to see her , because the Mem Sahib -- Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else -- was such a tall , slim , pretty person and wore such lovely clothes .\nHer hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things , and she had large laughing eyes .\nAll her clothes were thin and floating , and Mary said they were \" full of lace . \"\nThey looked fuller of lace than ever this morning , but her eyes were not laughing at all .\nThey were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer 's face .\n\" Is it so very bad ?\nOh , is it ? \"\nMary heard her say .\n\" Awfully , \" the young man answered in a trembling voice .\n\" Awfully , Mrs. Lennox .\nYou ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago . \"\nThe Mem Sahib wrung her hands .\n\" Oh , I know I ought ! \" she cried .\n\" I only stayed to go to that silly dinner party .\nWhat a fool I was ! \"\nAt that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the servants ' quarters that she clutched the young man 's arm , and Mary stood shivering from head to foot .\nThe wailing grew wilder and wilder .\n\" What is it ?\nWhat is it ? \"\nMrs. Lennox gasped .\n\" Some one has died , \" answered the boy officer .\n\" You did not say it had broken out among your servants . \"\n\" I did not know ! \" the Mem Sahib cried .\n\" Come with me !\nCome with me ! \" and she turned and ran into the house .\nAfter that , appalling things happened , and the mysteriousness of the morning was explained to Mary .\nThe cholera had broken out in its most fatal form and people were dying like flies .\nThe Ayah had been taken ill in the night , and it was because she had just died that the servants had wailed in the huts .\nBefore the next day three other servants were dead and others had run away in terror .\nThere was panic on every side , and dying people in all the bungalows .\nDuring the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone .\nNobody thought of her , nobody wanted her , and strange things happened of which she knew nothing .\nMary alternately cried and slept through the hours .\nShe only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening sounds .\nOnce she crept into the dining-room and found it empty , though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason .\nThe child ate some fruit and biscuits , and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled .\nIt was sweet , and she did not know how strong it was .\nVery soon it made her intensely drowsy , and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again , frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet .\nThe wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time .\nMany things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily , but she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carried in and out of the bungalow .\nWhen she awakened she lay and stared at the wall .\nThe house was perfectly still .\nShe had never known it to be so silent before .\nShe heard neither voices nor footsteps , and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over .\nShe wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead .\nThere would be a new Ayah , and perhaps she would know some new stories .\nMary had been rather tired of the old ones .\nShe did not cry because her nurse had died .\nShe was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one .\nThe noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her , and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive .\nEveryone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of .\nWhen people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves .\nBut if everyone had got well again , surely some one would remember and come to look for her .\nBut no one came , and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent .\nShe heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels .\nShe was not frightened , because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room .\nHe slipped under the door as she watched him .\n\" How queer and quiet it is , \" she said .\n\" It sounds as if there were no one in the bungalow but me and the snake . \"\nAlmost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound , and then on the veranda .\nThey were men 's footsteps , and the men entered the bungalow and talked in low voices .\nNo one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms .\n\" What desolation ! \" she heard one voice say .\n\" That pretty , pretty woman !\nI suppose the child , too .\nI heard there was a child , though no one ever saw her . \"\nMary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later .\nShe looked an ugly , cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected .\nThe first man who came in was a large officer she had once seen talking to her father .\nHe looked tired and troubled , but when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back .\n\" Barney ! \" he cried out .\n\" There is a child here !\nA child alone !\nIn a place like this !\nMercy on us , who is she ! \"\n\" I am Mary Lennox , \" the little girl said , drawing herself up stiffly .\nShe thought the man was very rude to call her father 's bungalow \" A place like this ! \"\n\" I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I have only just wakened up .\nWhy does nobody come ? \"\n\" It is the child no one ever saw ! \" exclaimed the man , turning to his companions .\n\" She has actually been forgotten ! \"\n",

    "I am a rather elderly man .\nThe nature of my avocations for the last thirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what would seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men , of whom as yet nothing that I know of has ever been written : -- I mean the law-copyists or scriveners .\nI have known very many of them , professionally and privately , and if I pleased , could relate divers histories , at which good-natured gentlemen might smile , and sentimental souls might weep .\nBut I waive the biographies of all other scriveners for a few passages in the life of Bartleby , who was a scrivener of the strangest I ever saw or heard of .\nWhile of other law-copyists I might write the complete life , of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done .\nI believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography of this man .\nIt is an irreparable loss to literature .\nBartleby was one of those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable , except from the original sources , and in his case those are very small .\nWhat my own astonished eyes saw of Bartleby , _ that _ is all I know of him , except , indeed , one vague report which will appear in the sequel .\nEre introducing the scrivener , as he first appeared to me , it is fit I make some mention of myself , my _ employees _ , my business , my chambers , and general surroundings ; because some such description is indispensable to an adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented .\nImprimis : I am a man who , from his youth upwards , has been filled with a profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best .\nHence , though I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous , even to turbulence , at times , yet nothing of that sort have I ever suffered to invade my peace .\nI am one of those unambitious lawyers who never addresses a jury , or in any way draws down public applause ; but in the cool tranquility of a snug retreat , do a snug business among rich men 's bonds and mortgages and title-deeds .\nAll who know me , consider me an eminently _ safe _ man .\nThe late John Jacob Astor , a personage little given to poetic enthusiasm , had no hesitation in pronouncing my first grand point to be prudence ; my next , method .\nI do not speak it in vanity , but simply record the fact , that I was not unemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor ; a name which , I admit , I love to repeat , for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to it , and rings like unto bullion .\nI will freely add , that I was not insensible to the late John Jacob Astor 's good opinion .\nSome time prior to the period at which this little history begins , my avocations had been largely increased .\nThe good old office , now extinct in the State of New York , of a Master in Chancery , had been conferred upon me .\nIt was not a very arduous office , but very pleasantly remunerative .\nI seldom lose my temper ; much more seldom indulge in dangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages ; but I must be permitted to be rash here and declare , that I consider the sudden and violent abrogation of the office of Master in Chancery , by the new Constitution , as a -- premature act ; inasmuch as I had counted upon a life-lease of the profits , whereas I only received those of a few short years .\nBut this is by the way .\nMy chambers were up stairs at No .\n-- Wall-street .\nAt one end they looked upon the white wall of the interior of a spacious sky-light shaft , penetrating the building from top to bottom .\nThis view might have been considered rather tame than otherwise , deficient in what landscape painters call \" life . \"\nBut if so , the view from the other end of my chambers offered , at least , a contrast , if nothing more .\nIn that direction my windows commanded an unobstructed view of a lofty brick wall , black by age and everlasting shade ; which wall required no spy-glass to bring out its lurking beauties , but for the benefit of all near-sighted spectators , was pushed up to within ten feet of my window panes .\nOwing to the great height of the surrounding buildings , and my chambers being on the second floor , the interval between this wall and mine not a little resembled a huge square cistern .\nAt the period just preceding the advent of Bartleby , I had two persons as copyists in my employment , and a promising lad as an office-boy .\nFirst , Turkey ; second , Nippers ; third , Ginger Nut .\nThese may seem names , the like of which are not usually found in the Directory .\nIn truth they were nicknames , mutually conferred upon each other by my three clerks , and were deemed expressive of their respective persons or characters .\nTurkey was a short , pursy Englishman of about my own age , that is , somewhere not far from sixty .\nIn the morning , one might say , his face was of a fine florid hue , but after twelve o'clock , meridian -- his dinner hour -- it blazed like a grate full of Christmas coals ; and continued blazing -- but , as it were , with a gradual wane -- till 6 o'clock , P.M. or thereabouts , after which I saw no more of the proprietor of the face , which gaining its meridian with the sun , seemed to set with it , to rise , culminate , and decline the following day , with the like regularity and undiminished glory .\nThere are many singular coincidences I have known in the course of my life , not the least among which was the fact , that exactly when Turkey displayed his fullest beams from his red and radiant countenance , just then , too , at that critical moment , began the daily period when I considered his business capacities as seriously disturbed for the remainder of the twenty-four hours .\nNot that he was absolutely idle , or averse to business then ; far from it .\nThe difficulty was , he was apt to be altogether too energetic .\nThere was a strange , inflamed , flurried , flighty recklessness of activity about him .\nHe would be incautious in dipping his pen into his inkstand .\nAll his blots upon my documents , were dropped there after twelve o'clock , meridian .\nIndeed , not only would he be reckless and sadly given to making blots in the afternoon , but some days he went further , and was rather noisy .\nAt such times , too , his face flamed with augmented blazonry , as if cannel coal had been heaped on anthracite .\nHe made an unpleasant racket with his chair ; spilled his sand-box ; in mending his pens , impatiently split them all to pieces , and threw them on the floor in a sudden passion ; stood up and leaned over his table , boxing his papers about in a most indecorous manner , very sad to behold in an elderly man like him .\nNevertheless , as he was in many ways a most valuable person to me , and all the time before twelve o'clock , meridian , was the quickest , steadiest creature too , accomplishing a great deal of work in a style not easy to be matched -- for these reasons , I was willing to overlook his eccentricities , though indeed , occasionally , I remonstrated with him .\nI did this very gently , however , because , though the civilest , nay , the blandest and most reverential of men in the morning , yet in the afternoon he was disposed , upon provocation , to be slightly rash with his tongue , in fact , insolent .\nNow , valuing his morning services as I did , and resolved not to lose them ; yet , at the same time made uncomfortable by his inflamed ways after twelve o'clock ; and being a man of peace , unwilling by my admonitions to call forth unseemly retorts from him ; I took upon me , one Saturday noon ( he was always worse on Saturdays ) , to hint to him , very kindly , that perhaps now that he was growing old , it might be well to abridge his labors ; in short , he need not come to my chambers after twelve o'clock , but , dinner over , had best go home to his lodgings and rest himself till teatime .\nBut no ; he insisted upon his afternoon devotions .\nHis countenance became intolerably fervid , as he oratorically assured me -- gesticulating with a long ruler at the other end of the room -- that if his services in the morning were useful , how indispensable , then , in the afternoon ?\n\" With submission , sir , \" said Turkey on this occasion , \" I consider myself your right-hand man .\nIn the morning I but marshal and deploy my columns ; but in the afternoon I put myself at their head , and gallantly charge the foe , thus ! \"\n-- and he made a violent thrust with the ruler .\n\" But the blots , Turkey , \" intimated I. \" True , -- but , with submission , sir , behold these hairs !\nI am getting old .\nSurely , sir , a blot or two of a warm afternoon is not to be severely urged against gray hairs .\nOld age -- even if it blot the page -- is honorable .\nWith submission , sir , we _ both _ are getting old . \"\nThis appeal to my fellow-feeling was hardly to be resisted .\nAt all events , I saw that go he would not .\nSo I made up my mind to let him stay , resolving , nevertheless , to see to it , that during the afternoon he had to do with my less important papers .\nNippers , the second on my list , was a whiskered , sallow , and , upon the whole , rather piratical-looking young man of about five and twenty .\nI always deemed him the victim of two evil powers -- ambition and indigestion .\nThe ambition was evinced by a certain impatience of the duties of a mere copyist , an unwarrantable usurpation of strictly professional affairs , such as the original drawing up of legal documents .\nThe indigestion seemed betokened in an occasional nervous testiness and grinning irritability , causing the teeth to audibly grind together over mistakes committed in copying ; unnecessary maledictions , hissed , rather than spoken , in the heat of business ; and especially by a continual discontent with the height of the table where he worked .\nThough of a very ingenious mechanical turn , Nippers could never get this table to suit him .\nHe put chips under it , blocks of various sorts , bits of pasteboard , and at last went so far as to attempt an exquisite adjustment by final pieces of folded blotting paper .\nBut no invention would answer .\nIf , for the sake of easing his back , he brought the table lid at a sharp angle well up towards his chin , and wrote there like a man using the steep roof of a Dutch house for his desk : -- then he declared that it stopped the circulation in his arms .\nIf now he lowered the table to his waistbands , and stooped over it in writing , then there was a sore aching in his back .\nIn short , the truth of the matter was , Nippers knew not what he wanted .\nOr , if he wanted any thing , it was to be rid of a scrivener 's table altogether .\nAmong the manifestations of his diseased ambition was a fondness he had for receiving visits from certain ambiguous-looking fellows in seedy coats , whom he called his clients .\nIndeed I was aware that not only was he , at times , considerable of a ward-politician , but he occasionally did a little business at the Justices ' courts , and was not unknown on the steps of the Tombs .\nI have good reason to believe , however , that one individual who called upon him at my chambers , and who , with a grand air , he insisted was his client , was no other than a dun , and the alleged title-deed , a bill .\nBut with all his failings , and the annoyances he caused me , Nippers , like his compatriot Turkey , was a very useful man to me ; wrote a neat , swift hand ; and , when he chose , was not deficient in a gentlemanly sort of deportment .\nAdded to this , he always dressed in a gentlemanly sort of way ; and so , incidentally , reflected credit upon my chambers .\nWhereas with respect to Turkey , I had much ado to keep him from being a reproach to me .\nHis clothes were apt to look oily and smell of eating-houses .\nHe wore his pantaloons very loose and baggy in summer .\nHis coats were execrable ; his hat not to be handled .\nBut while the hat was a thing of indifference to me , inasmuch as his natural civility and deference , as a dependent Englishman , always led him to doff it the moment he entered the room , yet his coat was another matter .\nConcerning his coats , I reasoned with him ; but with no effect .\nThe truth was , I suppose , that a man of so small an income , could not afford to sport such a lustrous face and a lustrous coat at one and the same time .\nAs Nippers once observed , Turkey 's money went chiefly for red ink .\nOne winter day I presented Turkey with a highly-respectable looking coat of my own , a padded gray coat , of a most comfortable warmth , and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck .\nI thought Turkey would appreciate the favor , and abate his rashness and obstreperousness of afternoons .\nBut no .\nI verily believe that buttoning himself up in so downy and blanket-like a coat had a pernicious effect upon him ; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses .\nIn fact , precisely as a rash , restive horse is said to feel his oats , so Turkey felt his coat .\nIt made him insolent .\nHe was a man whom prosperity harmed .\n",

    "CHAP .\nI. Mary , the heroine of this fiction , was the daughter of Edward , who married Eliza , a gentle , fashionable girl , with a kind of indolence in her temper , which might be termed negative good-nature : her virtues , indeed , were all of that stamp .\nShe carefully attended to the _ shews _ of things , and her opinions , I should have said prejudices , were such as the generality approved of .\nShe was educated with the expectation of a large fortune , of course became a mere machine : the homage of her attendants made a great part of her puerile amusements , and she never imagined there were any relative duties for her to fulfil : notions of her own consequence , by these means , were interwoven in her mind , and the years of youth spent in acquiring a few superficial accomplishments , without having any taste for them .\nWhen she was first introduced into the polite circle , she danced with an officer , whom she faintly wished to be united to ; but her father soon after recommending another in a more distinguished rank of life , she readily submitted to his will , and promised to love , honour , and obey , ( a vicious fool , ) as in duty bound .\nWhile they resided in London , they lived in the usual fashionable style , and seldom saw each other ; nor were they much more sociable when they wooed rural felicity for more than half the year , in a delightful country , where Nature , with lavish hand , had scattered beauties around ; for the master , with brute , unconscious gaze , passed them by unobserved , and sought amusement in country sports .\nHe hunted in the morning , and after eating an immoderate dinner , generally fell asleep : this seasonable rest enabled him to digest the cumbrous load ; he would then visit some of his pretty tenants ; and when he compared their ruddy glow of health with his wife 's countenance , which even rouge could not enliven , it is not necessary to say which a _ gourmand _ would give the preference to .\nTheir vulgar dance of spirits were infinitely more agreeable to his fancy than her sickly , die-away languor .\nHer voice was but the shadow of a sound , and she had , to complete her delicacy , so relaxed her nerves , that she became a mere nothing .\nMany such noughts are there in the female world !\nyet she had a good opinion of her own merit , -- truly , she said long prayers , -- and sometimes read her Week 's Preparation : she dreaded that horrid place vulgarly called _ hell _ , the regions below ; but whether her 's was a mounting spirit , I can not pretend to determine ; or what sort of a planet would have been proper for her , when she left her _ material _ part in this world , let metaphysicians settle ; I have nothing to say to her unclothed spirit .\nAs she was sometimes obliged to be alone , or only with her French waiting-maid , she sent to the metropolis for all the new publications , and while she was dressing her hair , and she could turn her eyes from the glass , she ran over those most delightful substitutes for bodily dissipation , novels .\nI say bodily , or the animal soul , for a rational one can find no employment in polite circles .\nThe glare of lights , the studied inelegancies of dress , and the compliments offered up at the shrine of false beauty , are all equally addressed to the senses .\nWhen she could not any longer indulge the caprices of fancy one way , she tried another .\nThe Platonic Marriage , Eliza Warwick , and some other interesting tales were perused with eagerness .\nNothing could be more natural than the developement of the passions , nor more striking than the views of the human heart .\nWhat delicate struggles !\nand uncommonly pretty turns of thought !\nThe picture that was found on a bramble-bush , the new sensitive-plant , or tree , which caught the swain by the upper-garment , and presented to his ravished eyes a portrait .\n-- Fatal image !\n-- It planted a thorn in a till then insensible heart , and sent a new kind of a knight-errant into the world .\nBut even this was nothing to the catastrophe , and the circumstance on which it hung , the hornet settling on the sleeping lover 's face .\nWhat a _ heart-rending _ accident !\nShe planted , in imitation of those susceptible souls , a rose bush ; but there was not a lover to weep in concert with her , when she watered it with her tears .\n-- Alas !\nAlas !\nIf my readers would excuse the sportiveness of fancy , and give me credit for genius , I would go on and tell them such tales as would force the sweet tears of sensibility to flow in copious showers down beautiful cheeks , to the discomposure of rouge , & c. & c. Nay , I would make it so interesting , that the fair peruser should beg the hair-dresser to settle the curls himself , and not interrupt her .\nShe had besides another resource , two most beautiful dogs , who shared her bed , and reclined on cushions near her all the day .\nThese she watched with the most assiduous care , and bestowed on them the warmest caresses .\nThis fondness for animals was not that kind of _ attendrissement _ which makes a person take pleasure in providing for the subsistence and comfort of a living creature ; but it proceeded from vanity , it gave her an opportunity of lisping out the prettiest French expressions of ecstatic fondness , in accents that had never been attuned by tenderness .\nShe was chaste , according to the vulgar acceptation of the word , that is , she did not make any actual _ faux pas _ ; she feared the world , and was indolent ; but then , to make amends for this seeming self-denial , she read all the sentimental novels , dwelt on the love-scenes , and , had she thought while she read , her mind would have been contaminated ; as she accompanied the lovers to the lonely arbors , and would walk with them by the clear light of the moon .\nShe wondered her husband did not stay at home .\nShe was jealous -- why did he not love her , sit by her side , squeeze her hand , and look unutterable things ?\nGentle reader , I will tell thee ; they neither of them felt what they could not utter .\nI will not pretend to say that they always annexed an idea to a word ; but they had none of those feelings which are not easily analyzed .\nCHAP .\nII .\nIn due time she brought forth a son , a feeble babe ; and the following year a daughter .\nAfter the mother 's throes she felt very few sentiments of maternal tenderness : the children were given to nurses , and she played with her dogs .\nWant of exercise prevented the least chance of her recovering strength ; and two or three milk-fevers brought on a consumption , to which her constitution tended .\nHer children all died in their infancy , except the two first , and she began to grow fond of the son , as he was remarkably handsome .\nFor years she divided her time between the sofa , and the card-table .\nShe thought not of death , though on the borders of the grave ; nor did any of the duties of her station occur to her as necessary .\nHer children were left in the nursery ; and when Mary , the little blushing girl , appeared , she would send the awkward thing away .\nTo own the truth , she was awkward enough , in a house without any play-mates ; for her brother had been sent to school , and she scarcely knew how to employ herself ; she would ramble about the garden , admire the flowers , and play with the dogs .\nAn old house-keeper told her stories , read to her , and , at last , taught her to read .\nHer mother talked of enquiring for a governess when her health would permit ; and , in the interim desired her own maid to teach her French .\nAs she had learned to read , she perused with avidity every book that came in her way .\nNeglected in every respect , and left to the operations of her own mind , she considered every thing that came under her inspection , and learned to think .\nShe had heard of a separate state , and that angels sometimes visited this earth .\nShe would sit in a thick wood in the park , and talk to them ; make little songs addressed to them , and sing them to tunes of her own composing ; and her native wood notes wild were sweet and touching .\nHer father always exclaimed against female acquirements , and was glad that his wife 's indolence and ill health made her not trouble herself about them .\nShe had besides another reason , she did not wish to have a fine tall girl brought forward into notice as her daughter ; she still expected to recover , and figure away in the gay world .\nHer husband was very tyrannical and passionate ; indeed so very easily irritated when inebriated , that Mary was continually in dread lest he should frighten her mother to death ; her sickness called forth all Mary 's tenderness , and exercised her compassion so continually , that it became more than a match for self-love , and was the governing propensity of her heart through life .\nShe was violent in her temper ; but she saw her father 's faults , and would weep when obliged to compare his temper with her own .\n-- She did more ; artless prayers rose to Heaven for pardon , when she was conscious of having erred ; and her contrition was so exceedingly painful , that she watched diligently the first movements of anger and impatience , to save herself this cruel remorse .\nSublime ideas filled her young mind -- always connected with devotional sentiments ; extemporary effusions of gratitude , and rhapsodies of praise would burst often from her , when she listened to the birds , or pursued the deer .\nShe would gaze on the moon , and ramble through the gloomy path , observing the various shapes the clouds assumed , and listen to the sea that was not far distant .\nThe wandering spirits , which she imagined inhabited every part of nature , were her constant friends and confidants .\nShe began to consider the Great First Cause , formed just notions of his attributes , and , in particular , dwelt on his wisdom and goodness .\nCould she have loved her father or mother , had they returned her affection , she would not so soon , perhaps , have sought out a new world .\nHer sensibility prompted her to search for an object to love ; on earth it was not to be found : her mother had often disappointed her , and the apparent partiality she shewed to her brother gave her exquisite pain -- produced a kind of habitual melancholy , led her into a fondness for reading tales of woe , and made her almost realize the fictitious distress .\n",

    "CHAPTER I A RED-HAIRED GIRL The residence of Mr. Peter Pett , the well-known financier , on Riverside Drive is one of the leading eyesores of that breezy and expensive boulevard .\nAs you pass by in your limousine , or while enjoying ten cents worth of fresh air on top of a green omnibus , it jumps out and bites at you .\nArchitects , confronted with it , reel and throw up their hands defensively , and even the lay observer has a sense of shock .\nThe place resembles in almost equal proportions a cathedral , a suburban villa , a hotel and a Chinese pagoda .\nMany of its windows are of stained glass , and above the porch stand two terra-cotta lions , considerably more repulsive even than the complacent animals which guard New York 's Public Library .\nIt is a house which is impossible to overlook : and it was probably for this reason that Mrs. Pett insisted on her husband buying it , for she was a woman who liked to be noticed .\nThrough the rich interior of this mansion Mr. Pett , its nominal proprietor , was wandering like a lost spirit .\nThe hour was about ten of a fine Sunday morning , but the Sabbath calm which was upon the house had not communicated itself to him .\nThere was a look of exasperation on his usually patient face , and a muttered oath , picked up no doubt on the godless Stock Exchange , escaped his lips .\n\" Darn it ! \"\nHe was afflicted by a sense of the pathos of his position .\nIt was not as if he demanded much from life .\nHe asked but little here below .\nAt that moment all that he wanted was a quiet spot where he might read his Sunday paper in solitary peace , and he could not find one .\nIntruders lurked behind every door .\nThe place was congested .\nThis sort of thing had been growing worse and worse ever since his marriage two years previously .\nThere was a strong literary virus in Mrs. Pett 's system .\nShe not only wrote voluminously herself -- the name Nesta Ford Pett is familiar to all lovers of sensational fiction -- but aimed at maintaining a salon .\nStarting , in pursuance of this aim , with a single specimen , -- her nephew , Willie Partridge , who was working on a new explosive which would eventually revolutionise war -- she had gradually added to her collections , until now she gave shelter beneath her terra-cotta roof to no fewer than six young and unrecognised geniuses .\nSix brilliant youths , mostly novelists who had not yet started and poets who were about to begin , cluttered up Mr. Pett 's rooms on this fair June morning , while he , clutching his Sunday paper , wandered about , finding , like the dove in Genesis , no rest .\nIt was at such times that he was almost inclined to envy his wife 's first husband , a business friend of his named Elmer Ford , who had perished suddenly of an apoplectic seizure : and the pity which he generally felt for the deceased tended to shift its focus .\nMarriage had certainly complicated life for Mr. Pett , as it frequently does for the man who waits fifty years before trying it .\nIn addition to the geniuses , Mrs. Pett had brought with her to her new home her only son , Ogden , a fourteen-year-old boy of a singularly unloveable type .\nYears of grown-up society and the absence of anything approaching discipline had given him a precocity on which the earnest efforts of a series of private tutors had expended themselves in vain .\nThey came , full of optimism and self-confidence , to retire after a brief interval , shattered by the boy 's stodgy resistance to education in any form or shape .\nTo Mr. Pett , never at his ease with boys , Ogden Ford was a constant irritant .\nHe disliked his stepson 's personality , and he more than suspected him of stealing his cigarettes .\nIt was an additional annoyance that he was fully aware of the impossibility of ever catching him at it .\nMr. Pett resumed his journey .\nHe had interrupted it for a moment to listen at the door of the morning-room , but , a remark in a high tenor voice about the essential Christianity of the poet Shelley filtering through the oak , he had moved on .\nSilence from behind another door farther down the passage encouraged him to place his fingers on the handle , but a crashing chord from an unseen piano made him remove them swiftly .\nHe roamed on , and a few minutes later the process of elimination had brought him to what was technically his own private library -- a large , soothing room full of old books , of which his father had been a great collector .\nMr. Pett did not read old books himself , but he liked to be among them , and it is proof of his pessimism that he had not tried the library first .\nTo his depressed mind it had seemed hardly possible that there could be nobody there .\nHe stood outside the door , listening tensely .\nHe could hear nothing .\nHe went in , and for an instant experienced that ecstatic thrill which only comes to elderly gentlemen of solitary habit who in a house full of their juniors find themselves alone at last .\nThen a voice spoke , shattering his dream of solitude .\n\" Hello , pop ! \"\nOgden Ford was sprawling in a deep chair in the shadows .\n\" Come in , pop , come in .\nLots of room . \"\nMr. Pett stood in the doorway , regarding his step-son with a sombre eye .\nHe resented the boy 's tone of easy patronage , all the harder to endure with philosophic calm at the present moment from the fact that the latter was lounging in his favourite chair .\nEven from an aesthetic point of view the sight of the bulging child offended him .\nOgden Ford was round and blobby and looked overfed .\nHe had the plethoric habit of one to whom wholesome exercise is a stranger and the sallow complexion of the confirmed candy-fiend .\nEven now , a bare half hour after breakfast , his jaws were moving with a rhythmical , champing motion .\n\" What are you eating , boy ? \" demanded Mr. Pett , his disappointment turning to irritability .\n\" Candy . \"\n\" I wish you would not eat candy all day . \"\n\" Mother gave it to me , \" said Ogden simply .\nAs he had anticipated , the shot silenced the enemy 's battery .\nMr. Pett grunted , but made no verbal comment .\nOgden celebrated his victory by putting another piece of candy in his mouth .\n\" Got a grouch this morning , have n't you , pop ? \"\n\" I will not be spoken to like that ! \"\n\" I thought you had , \" said his step-son complacently .\n\" I can always tell .\nI do n't see why you want to come picking on me , though .\nI 've done nothing . \"\nMr. Pett was sniffing suspiciously .\n\" You 've been smoking . \"\n\" Me !! \"\n\" Smoking cigarettes . \"\n\" No , sir ! \"\n\" There are two butts in the ash-tray . \"\n\" I did n't put them there . \"\n\" One of them is warm . \"\n\" It 's a warm day . \"\n\" You dropped it there when you heard me come in . \"\n\" No , sir !\nI 've only been here a few minutes .\nI guess one of the fellows was in here before me .\nThey 're always swiping your coffin-nails .\nYou ought to do something about it , pop .\nYou ought to assert yourself . \"\nA sense of helplessness came upon Mr. Pett .\nFor the thousandth time he felt himself baffled by this calm , goggle-eyed boy who treated him with such supercilious coolness .\n\" You ought to be out in the open air this lovely morning , \" he said feebly .\n\" All right .\nLet 's go for a walk .\nI will if you will . \"\n\" I -- I have other things to do , \" said Mr. Pett , recoiling from the prospect .\n\" Well , this fresh-air stuff is overrated anyway .\nWhere 's the sense of having a home if you do n't stop in it ? \"\n\" When I was your age , I would have been out on a morning like this -- er -- bowling my hoop . \"\n\" And look at you now ! \"\n\" What do you mean ? \"\n\" Martyr to lumbago . \"\n\" I am not a martyr to lumbago , \" said Mr. Pett , who was touchy on the subject .\n\" Have it your own way .\nAll I know is -- \" \" Never mind ! \"\n\" I 'm only saying what mother . . . \" \" Be quiet ! \"\nOgden made further researches in the candy box .\n\" Have some , pop ? \"\n\" No . \"\n\" Quite right .\nGot to be careful at your age . \"\n\" What do you mean ? \"\n\" Getting on , you know .\nNot so young as you used to be .\nCome in , pop , if you 're coming in .\nThere 's a draft from that door . \"\nMr. Pett retired , fermenting .\nHe wondered how another man would have handled this situation .\nThe ridiculous inconsistency of the human character infuriated him .\nWhy should he be a totally different man on Riverside Drive from the person he was in Pine Street ?\nWhy should he be able to hold his own in Pine Street with grown men -- whiskered , square-jawed financiers -- and yet be unable on Riverside Drive to eject a fourteen-year-old boy from an easy chair ?\nIt seemed to him sometimes that a curious paralysis of the will came over him out of business hours .\nMeanwhile , he had still to find a place where he could read his Sunday paper .\nHe stood for a while in thought .\nThen his brow cleared , and he began to mount the stairs .\nReaching the top floor , he walked along the passage and knocked on a door at the end of it .\nFrom behind this door , as from behind those below , sounds proceeded , but this time they did not seem to discourage Mr. Pett .\nIt was the tapping of a typewriter that he heard , and he listened to it with an air of benevolent approval .\nHe loved to hear the sound of a typewriter : it made home so like the office .\n\" Come in , \" called a girl 's voice .\nThe room in which Mr. Pett found himself was small but cosy , and its cosiness -- oddly , considering the sex of its owner -- had that peculiar quality which belongs as a rule to the dens of men .\nA large bookcase almost covered one side of it , its reds and blues and browns smiling cheerfully at whoever entered .\nThe walls were hung with prints , judiciously chosen and arranged .\nThrough a window to the left , healthfully open at the bottom , the sun streamed in , bringing with it the pleasantly subdued whirring of automobiles out on the Drive .\nAt a desk at right angles to this window , her vivid red-gold hair rippling in the breeze from the river , sat the girl who had been working at the typewriter .\nShe turned as Mr. Pett entered , and smiled over her shoulder .\n",

    "CHAPTER 1 “ Mine ear is open , and my heart prepared : The worst is wordly loss thou canst unfold : -- Say , is my kingdom lost ? ”\n-- Shakespeare It was a feature peculiar to the colonial wars of North America , that the toils and dangers of the wilderness were to be encountered before the adverse hosts could meet .\nA wide and apparently an impervious boundary of forests severed the possessions of the hostile provinces of France and England .\nThe hardy colonist , and the trained European who fought at his side , frequently expended months in struggling against the rapids of the streams , or in effecting the rugged passes of the mountains , in quest of an opportunity to exhibit their courage in a more martial conflict .\nBut , emulating the patience and self-denial of the practiced native warriors , they learned to overcome every difficulty ; and it would seem that , in time , there was no recess of the woods so dark , nor any secret place so lovely , that it might claim exemption from the inroads of those who had pledged their blood to satiate their vengeance , or to uphold the cold and selfish policy of the distant monarchs of Europe .\nPerhaps no district throughout the wide extent of the intermediate frontiers can furnish a livelier picture of the cruelty and fierceness of the savage warfare of those periods than the country which lies between the head waters of the Hudson and the adjacent lakes .\nThe facilities which nature had there offered to the march of the combatants were too obvious to be neglected .\nThe lengthened sheet of the Champlain stretched from the frontiers of Canada , deep within the borders of the neighboring province of New York , forming a natural passage across half the distance that the French were compelled to master in order to strike their enemies .\nNear its southern termination , it received the contributions of another lake , whose waters were so limpid as to have been exclusively selected by the Jesuit missionaries to perform the typical purification of baptism , and to obtain for it the title of lake “ du Saint Sacrement . ”\nThe less zealous English thought they conferred a sufficient honor on its unsullied fountains , when they bestowed the name of their reigning prince , the second of the house of Hanover .\nThe two united to rob the untutored possessors of its wooded scenery of their native right to perpetuate its original appellation of “ Horican . ”\n* * As each nation of the Indians had its language or its dialect , they usually gave different names to the same places , though nearly all of their appellations were descriptive of the object .\nThus a literal translation of the name of this beautiful sheet of water , used by the tribe that dwelt on its banks , would be “ The Tail of the Lake . ”\nLake George , as it is vulgarly , and now , indeed , legally , called , forms a sort of tail to Lake Champlain , when viewed on the map .\nHence , the name .\nWinding its way among countless islands , and imbedded in mountains , the “ holy lake ” extended a dozen leagues still further to the south .\nWith the high plain that there interposed itself to the further passage of the water , commenced a portage of as many miles , which conducted the adventurer to the banks of the Hudson , at a point where , with the usual obstructions of the rapids , or rifts , as they were then termed in the language of the country , the river became navigable to the tide .\nWhile , in the pursuit of their daring plans of annoyance , the restless enterprise of the French even attempted the distant and difficult gorges of the Alleghany , it may easily be imagined that their proverbial acuteness would not overlook the natural advantages of the district we have just described .\nIt became , emphatically , the bloody arena , in which most of the battles for the mastery of the colonies were contested .\nForts were erected at the different points that commanded the facilities of the route , and were taken and retaken , razed and rebuilt , as victory alighted on the hostile banners .\nWhile the husbandman shrank back from the dangerous passes , within the safer boundaries of the more ancient settlements , armies larger than those that had often disposed of the scepters of the mother countries , were seen to bury themselves in these forests , whence they rarely returned but in skeleton bands , that were haggard with care or dejected by defeat .\nThough the arts of peace were unknown to this fatal region , its forests were alive with men ; its shades and glens rang with the sounds of martial music , and the echoes of its mountains threw back the laugh , or repeated the wanton cry , of many a gallant and reckless youth , as he hurried by them , in the noontide of his spirits , to slumber in a long night of forgetfulness .\nIt was in this scene of strife and bloodshed that the incidents we shall attempt to relate occurred , during the third year of the war which England and France last waged for the possession of a country that neither was destined to retain .\nThe imbecility of her military leaders abroad , and the fatal want of energy in her councils at home , had lowered the character of Great Britain from the proud elevation on which it had been placed by the talents and enterprise of her former warriors and statesmen .\nNo longer dreaded by her enemies , her servants were fast losing the confidence of self-respect .\nIn this mortifying abasement , the colonists , though innocent of her imbecility , and too humble to be the agents of her blunders , were but the natural participators .\nThey had recently seen a chosen army from that country , which , reverencing as a mother , they had blindly believed invincible -- an army led by a chief who had been selected from a crowd of trained warriors , for his rare military endowments , disgracefully routed by a handful of French and Indians , and only saved from annihilation by the coolness and spirit of a Virginian boy , whose riper fame has since diffused itself , with the steady influence of moral truth , to the uttermost confines of Christendom .\n* A wide frontier had been laid naked by this unexpected disaster , and more substantial evils were preceded by a thousand fanciful and imaginary dangers .\nThe alarmed colonists believed that the yells of the savages mingled with every fitful gust of wind that issued from the interminable forests of the west .\nThe terrific character of their merciless enemies increased immeasurably the natural horrors of warfare .\nNumberless recent massacres were still vivid in their recollections ; nor was there any ear in the provinces so deaf as not to have drunk in with avidity the narrative of some fearful tale of midnight murder , in which the natives of the forests were the principal and barbarous actors .\nAs the credulous and excited traveler related the hazardous chances of the wilderness , the blood of the timid curdled with terror , and mothers cast anxious glances even at those children which slumbered within the security of the largest towns .\nIn short , the magnifying influence of fear began to set at naught the calculations of reason , and to render those who should have remembered their manhood , the slaves of the basest passions .\nEven the most confident and the stoutest hearts began to think the issue of the contest was becoming doubtful ; and that abject class was hourly increasing in numbers , who thought they foresaw all the possessions of the English crown in America subdued by their Christian foes , or laid waste by the inroads of their relentless allies .\n* Washington , who , after uselessly admonishing the European general of the danger into which he was heedlessly running , saved the remnants of the British army , on this occasion , by his decision and courage .\nThe reputation earned by Washington in this battle was the principal cause of his being selected to command the American armies at a later day .\nIt is a circumstance worthy of observation , that while all America rang with his well-merited reputation , his name does not occur in any European account of the battle ; at least the author has searched for it without success .\nIn this manner does the mother country absorb even the fame , under that system of rule .\nWhen , therefore , intelligence was received at the fort which covered the southern termination of the portage between the Hudson and the lakes , that Montcalm had been seen moving up the Champlain , with an army “ numerous as the leaves on the trees , ” its truth was admitted with more of the craven reluctance of fear than with the stern joy that a warrior should feel , in finding an enemy within reach of his blow .\nThe news had been brought , toward the decline of a day in midsummer , by an Indian runner , who also bore an urgent request from Munro , the commander of a work on the shore of the “ holy lake , ” for a speedy and powerful reinforcement .\nIt has already been mentioned that the distance between these two posts was less than five leagues .\nThe rude path , which originally formed their line of communication , had been widened for the passage of wagons ; so that the distance which had been traveled by the son of the forest in two hours , might easily be effected by a detachment of troops , with their necessary baggage , between the rising and setting of a summer sun .\nThe loyal servants of the British crown had given to one of these forest-fastnesses the name of William Henry , and to the other that of Fort Edward , calling each after a favorite prince of the reigning family .\nThe veteran Scotchman just named held the first , with a regiment of regulars and a few provincials ; a force really by far too small to make head against the formidable power that Montcalm was leading to the foot of his earthen mounds .\nAt the latter , however , lay General Webb , who commanded the armies of the king in the northern provinces , with a body of more than five thousand men .\nBy uniting the several detachments of his command , this officer might have arrayed nearly double that number of combatants against the enterprising Frenchman , who had ventured so far from his reinforcements , with an army but little superior in numbers .\nBut under the influence of their degraded fortunes , both officers and men appeared better disposed to await the approach of their formidable antagonists , within their works , than to resist the progress of their march , by emulating the successful example of the French at Fort du Quesne , and striking a blow on their advance .\nAfter the first surprise of the intelligence had a little abated , a rumor was spread through the entrenched camp , which stretched along the margin of the Hudson , forming a chain of outworks to the body of the fort itself , that a chosen detachment of fifteen hundred men was to depart , with the dawn , for William Henry , the post at the northern extremity of the portage .\nThat which at first was only rumor , soon became certainty , as orders passed from the quarters of the commander-in-chief to the several corps he had selected for this service , to prepare for their speedy departure .\nAll doubts as to the intention of Webb now vanished , and an hour or two of hurried footsteps and anxious faces succeeded .\nThe novice in the military art flew from point to point , retarding his own preparations by the excess of his violent and somewhat distempered zeal ; while the more practiced veteran made his arrangements with a deliberation that scorned every appearance of haste ; though his sober lineaments and anxious eye sufficiently betrayed that he had no very strong professional relish for the , as yet , untried and dreaded warfare of the wilderness .\nAt length the sun set in a flood of glory , behind the distant western hills , and as darkness drew its veil around the secluded spot the sounds of preparation diminished ; the last light finally disappeared from the log cabin of some officer ; the trees cast their deeper shadows over the mounds and the rippling stream , and a silence soon pervaded the camp , as deep as that which reigned in the vast forest by which it was environed .\n",

    "PART I. FRIENDS OF CHILDHOOD I Dr. Howard Archie had just come up from a game of pool with the Jewish clothier and two traveling men who happened to be staying overnight in Moonstone .\nHis offices were in the Duke Block , over the drug store .\nLarry , the doctor 's man , had lit the overhead light in the waiting-room and the double student 's lamp on the desk in the study .\nThe isinglass sides of the hard-coal burner were aglow , and the air in the study was so hot that as he came in the doctor opened the door into his little operating-room , where there was no stove .\nThe waiting room was carpeted and stiffly furnished , something like a country parlor .\nThe study had worn , unpainted floors , but there was a look of winter comfort about it .\nThe doctor 's flat-top desk was large and well made ; the papers were in orderly piles , under glass weights .\nBehind the stove a wide bookcase , with double glass doors , reached from the floor to the ceiling .\nIt was filled with medical books of every thickness and color .\nOn the top shelf stood a long row of thirty or forty volumes , bound all alike in dark mottled board covers , with imitation leather backs .\nAs the doctor in New England villages is proverbially old , so the doctor in small Colorado towns twenty-five years ago was generally young .\nDr. Archie was barely thirty .\nHe was tall , with massive shoulders which he held stiffly , and a large , well-shaped head .\nHe was a distinguished-looking man , for that part of the world , at least .\nThere was something individual in the way in which his reddish-brown hair , parted cleanly at the side , bushed over his high forehead .\nHis nose was straight and thick , and his eyes were intelligent .\nHe wore a curly , reddish mustache and an imperial , cut trimly , which made him look a little like the pictures of Napoleon III .\nHis hands were large and well kept , but ruggedly formed , and the backs were shaded with crinkly reddish hair .\nHe wore a blue suit of woolly , wide-waled serge ; the traveling men had known at a glance that it was made by a Denver tailor .\nThe doctor was always well dressed .\nDr. Archie turned up the student 's lamp and sat down in the swivel chair before his desk .\nHe sat uneasily , beating a tattoo on his knees with his fingers , and looked about him as if he were bored .\nHe glanced at his watch , then absently took from his pocket a bunch of small keys , selected one and looked at it .\nA contemptuous smile , barely perceptible , played on his lips , but his eyes remained meditative .\nBehind the door that led into the hall , under his buffalo-skin driving-coat , was a locked cupboard .\nThis the doctor opened mechanically , kicking aside a pile of muddy overshoes .\nInside , on the shelves , were whiskey glasses and decanters , lemons , sugar , and bitters .\nHearing a step in the empty , echoing hall without , the doctor closed the cupboard again , snapping the Yale lock .\nThe door of the waiting-room opened , a man entered and came on into the consulting-room .\n“ Good-evening , Mr. Kronborg , ” said the doctor carelessly .\n“ Sit down . ”\nHis visitor was a tall , loosely built man , with a thin brown beard , streaked with gray .\nHe wore a frock coat , a broad-brimmed black hat , a white lawn necktie , and steel rimmed spectacles .\nAltogether there was a pretentious and important air about him , as he lifted the skirts of his coat and sat down .\n“ Good-evening , doctor .\nCan you step around to the house with me ?\nI think Mrs. Kronborg will need you this evening . ”\nThis was said with profound gravity and , curiously enough , with a slight embarrassment .\n“ Any hurry ? ” the doctor asked over his shoulder as he went into his operating-room .\nMr. Kronborg coughed behind his hand , and contracted his brows .\nHis face threatened at every moment to break into a smile of foolish excitement .\nHe controlled it only by calling upon his habitual pulpit manner .\n“ Well , I think it would be as well to go immediately .\nMrs. Kronborg will be more comfortable if you are there .\nShe has been suffering for some time . ”\nThe doctor came back and threw a black bag upon his desk .\nHe wrote some instructions for his man on a prescription pad and then drew on his overcoat .\n“ All ready , ” he announced , putting out his lamp .\nMr. Kronborg rose and they tramped through the empty hall and down the stairway to the street .\nThe drug store below was dark , and the saloon next door was just closing .\nEvery other light on Main Street was out .\nOn either side of the road and at the outer edge of the board sidewalk , the snow had been shoveled into breastworks .\nThe town looked small and black , flattened down in the snow , muffled and all but extinguished .\nOverhead the stars shone gloriously .\nIt was impossible not to notice them .\nThe air was so clear that the white sand hills to the east of Moonstone gleamed softly .\nFollowing the Reverend Mr. Kronborg along the narrow walk , past the little dark , sleeping houses , the doctor looked up at the flashing night and whistled softly .\nIt did seem that people were stupider than they need be ; as if on a night like this there ought to be something better to do than to sleep nine hours , or to assist Mrs. Kronborg in functions which she could have performed so admirably unaided .\nHe wished he had gone down to Denver to hear Fay Templeton sing “ See-Saw . ”\nThen he remembered that he had a personal interest in this family , after all .\nThey turned into another street and saw before them lighted windows ; a low story-and-a-half house , with a wing built on at the right and a kitchen addition at the back , everything a little on the slant -- roofs , windows , and doors .\nAs they approached the gate , Peter Kronborg 's pace grew brisker .\nHis nervous , ministerial cough annoyed the doctor .\n“ Exactly as if he were going to give out a text , ” he thought .\nHe drew off his glove and felt in his vest pocket .\n“ Have a troche , Kronborg , ” he said , producing some .\n“ Sent me for samples .\nVery good for a rough throat . ”\n“ Ah , thank you , thank you .\nI was in something of a hurry .\nI neglected to put on my overshoes .\nHere we are , doctor . ”\nKronborg opened his front door -- seemed delighted to be at home again .\nThe front hall was dark and cold ; the hatrack was hung with an astonishing number of children 's hats and caps and cloaks .\nThey were even piled on the table beneath the hatrack .\nUnder the table was a heap of rubbers and overshoes .\nWhile the doctor hung up his coat and hat , Peter Kronborg opened the door into the living-room .\nA glare of light greeted them , and a rush of hot , stale air , smelling of warming flannels .\nAt three o'clock in the morning Dr. Archie was in the parlor putting on his cuffs and coat -- there was no spare bedroom in that house .\nPeter Kronborg 's seventh child , a boy , was being soothed and cosseted by his aunt , Mrs. Kronborg was asleep , and the doctor was going home .\nBut he wanted first to speak to Kronborg , who , coatless and fluttery , was pouring coal into the kitchen stove .\nAs the doctor crossed the dining-room he paused and listened .\nFrom one of the wing rooms , off to the left , he heard rapid , distressed breathing .\nHe went to the kitchen door .\n“ One of the children sick in there ? ” he asked , nodding toward the partition .\nKronborg hung up the stove-lifter and dusted his fingers .\n“ It must be Thea .\nI meant to ask you to look at her .\nShe has a croupy cold .\nBut in my excitement -- Mrs. Kronborg is doing finely , eh , doctor ?\nNot many of your patients with such a constitution , I expect . ”\n“ Oh , yes .\nShe 's a fine mother . ”\nThe doctor took up the lamp from the kitchen table and unceremoniously went into the wing room .\nTwo chubby little boys were asleep in a double bed , with the coverlids over their noses and their feet drawn up .\nIn a single bed , next to theirs , lay a little girl of eleven , wide awake , two yellow braids sticking up on the pillow behind her .\nHer face was scarlet and her eyes were blazing .\nThe doctor shut the door behind him .\n“ Feel pretty sick , Thea ? ” he asked as he took out his thermometer .\n“ Why did n't you call somebody ? ”\nShe looked at him with greedy affection .\n“ I thought you were here , ” she spoke between quick breaths .\n“ There is a new baby , is n't there ?\nWhich ? ”\n“ Which ? ” repeated the doctor .\n“ Brother or sister ? ”\nHe smiled and sat down on the edge of the bed .\n“ Brother , ” he said , taking her hand .\n“ Open . ”\n“ Good .\nBrothers are better , ” she murmured as he put the glass tube under her tongue .\n“ Now , be still , I want to count . ”\nDr. Archie reached for her hand and took out his watch .\nWhen he put her hand back under the quilt he went over to one of the windows -- they were both tight shut -- and lifted it a little way .\nHe reached up and ran his hand along the cold , unpapered wall .\n“ Keep under the covers ; I 'll come back to you in a moment , ” he said , bending over the glass lamp with his thermometer .\nHe winked at her from the door before he shut it .\nPeter Kronborg was sitting in his wife 's room , holding the bundle which contained his son .\nHis air of cheerful importance , his beard and glasses , even his shirt-sleeves , annoyed the doctor .\nHe beckoned Kronborg into the living-room and said sternly : -- “ You 've got a very sick child in there .\nWhy did n't you call me before ?\nIt 's pneumonia , and she must have been sick for several days .\nPut the baby down somewhere , please , and help me make up the bed-lounge here in the parlor .\nShe 's got to be in a warm room , and she 's got to be quiet .\nYou must keep the other children out .\nHere , this thing opens up , I see , ” swinging back the top of the carpet lounge .\n“ We can lift her mattress and carry her in just as she is .\nI do n't want to disturb her more than is necessary . ”\n",

    "I A STRANGER FROM SOUTH CAROLINA Time touches all things with destroying hand ; and if he seem now and then to bestow the bloom of youth , the sap of spring , it is but a brief mockery , to be surely and swiftly followed by the wrinkles of old age , the dry leaves and bare branches of winter .\nAnd yet there are places where Time seems to linger lovingly long after youth has departed , and to which he seems loath to bring the evil day .\nWho has not known some even-tempered old man or woman who seemed to have drunk of the fountain of youth ?\nWho has not seen somewhere an old town that , having long since ceased to grow , yet held its own without perceptible decline ?\nSome such trite reflection -- as apposite to the subject as most random reflections are -- passed through the mind of a young man who came out of the front door of the Patesville Hotel about nine o'clock one fine morning in spring , a few years after the Civil War , and started down Front Street toward the market-house .\nArriving at the town late the previous evening , he had been driven up from the steamboat in a carriage , from which he had been able to distinguish only the shadowy outlines of the houses along the street ; so that this morning walk was his first opportunity to see the town by daylight .\nHe was dressed in a suit of linen duck -- the day was warm -- a panama straw hat , and patent leather shoes .\nIn appearance he was tall , dark , with straight , black , lustrous hair , and very clean-cut , high-bred features .\nWhen he paused by the clerk 's desk on his way out , to light his cigar , the day clerk , who had just come on duty , glanced at the register and read the last entry : -- \" ' JOHN WARWICK , CLARENCE , SOUTH CAROLINA . '\n\" One of the South Ca ' lina bigbugs , I reckon -- probably in cotton , or turpentine . \"\nThe gentleman from South Carolina , walking down the street , glanced about him with an eager look , in which curiosity and affection were mingled with a touch of bitterness .\nHe saw little that was not familiar , or that he had not seen in his dreams a hundred times during the past ten years .\nThere had been some changes , it is true , some melancholy changes , but scarcely anything by way of addition or improvement to counterbalance them .\nHere and there blackened and dismantled walls marked the place where handsome buildings once had stood , for Sherman 's march to the sea had left its mark upon the town .\nThe stores were mostly of brick , two stories high , joining one another after the manner of cities .\nSome of the names on the signs were familiar ; others , including a number of Jewish names , were quite unknown to him .\nA two minutes ' walk brought Warwick -- the name he had registered under , and as we shall call him -- to the market-house , the central feature of Patesville , from both the commercial and the picturesque points of view .\nStanding foursquare in the heart of the town , at the intersection of the two main streets , a \" jog \" at each street corner left around the market-house a little public square , which at this hour was well occupied by carts and wagons from the country and empty drays awaiting hire .\nWarwick was unable to perceive much change in the market-house .\nPerhaps the surface of the red brick , long unpainted , had scaled off a little more here and there .\nThere might have been a slight accretion of the moss and lichen on the shingled roof .\nBut the tall tower , with its four-faced clock , rose as majestically and uncompromisingly as though the land had never been subjugated .\nWas it so irreconcilable , Warwick wondered , as still to peal out the curfew bell , which at nine o'clock at night had clamorously warned all negroes , slave or free , that it was unlawful for them to be abroad after that hour , under penalty of imprisonment or whipping ?\nWas the old constable , whose chief business it had been to ring the bell , still alive and exercising the functions of his office , and had age lessened or increased the number of times that obliging citizens performed this duty for him during his temporary absences in the company of convivial spirits ?\nA few moments later , Warwick saw a colored policeman in the old constable 's place -- a stronger reminder than even the burned buildings that war had left its mark upon the old town , with which Time had dealt so tenderly .\nThe lower story of the market-house was open on all four of its sides to the public square .\nWarwick passed through one of the wide brick arches and traversed the building with a leisurely step .\nHe looked in vain into the stalls for the butcher who had sold fresh meat twice a week , on market days , and he felt a genuine thrill of pleasure when he recognized the red bandana turban of old Aunt Lyddy , the ancient negro woman who had sold him gingerbread and fried fish , and told him weird tales of witchcraft and conjuration , in the old days when , as an idle boy , he had loafed about the market-house .\nHe did not speak to her , however , or give her any sign of recognition .\nHe threw a glance toward a certain corner where steps led to the town hall above .\nOn this stairway he had once seen a manacled free negro shot while being taken upstairs for examination under a criminal charge .\nWarwick recalled vividly how the shot had rung out .\nHe could see again the livid look of terror on the victim 's face , the gathering crowd , the resulting confusion .\nThe murderer , he recalled , had been tried and sentenced to imprisonment for life , but was pardoned by a merciful governor after serving a year of his sentence .\nAs Warwick was neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet , he could not foresee that , thirty years later , even this would seem an excessive punishment for so slight a misdemeanor .\nLeaving the market-house , Warwick turned to the left , and kept on his course until he reached the next corner .\nAfter another turn to the right , a dozen paces brought him in front of a small weather-beaten frame building , from which projected a wooden sign-board bearing the inscription : -- ARCHIBALD STRAIGHT , LAWYER .\nHe turned the knob , but the door was locked .\nRetracing his steps past a vacant lot , the young man entered a shop where a colored man was employed in varnishing a coffin , which stood on two trestles in the middle of the floor .\nNot at all impressed by the melancholy suggestiveness of his task , he was whistling a lively air with great gusto .\nUpon Warwick 's entrance this effusion came to a sudden end , and the coffin-maker assumed an air of professional gravity .\n\" Good-mawnin ' , suh , \" he said , lifting his cap politely .\n\" Good-morning , \" answered Warwick .\n\" Can you tell me anything about Judge Straight 's office hours ? \"\n\" De ole jedge has be 'n a little onreg ' lar sence de wah , suh ; but he gin ' ally gits roun ' ' bout ten o'clock er so .\nHe 's be 'n kin ' er feeble fer de las ' few yeahs .\nAn ' I reckon , \" continued the undertaker solemnly , his glance unconsciously seeking a row of fine caskets standing against the wall , -- \" I reckon he 'll soon be goin ' de way er all de earth .\n' Man dat is bawn er ' oman hath but a sho ' t time ter lib , an ' is full er mis ' ry .\nHe cometh up an ' is cut down lack as a flower . '\n' De days er his life is three-sco ' an ' ten ' -- an ' de ole jedge is libbed mo ' d' n dat , suh , by five yeahs , ter say de leas ' . \" \"\n' Death , ' \" quoted Warwick , with whose mood the undertaker 's remarks were in tune , \" ' is the penalty that all must pay for the crime of living . ' \"\n\" Dat 's a fac ' , suh , dat 's a fac ' ; so dey mus ' -- so dey mus ' .\nAn ' den all de dead has ter be buried .\nAn ' we does ou ' sheer of it , suh , we does ou ' sheer .\nWe conduc 's de obs ' quies er all de bes ' w ' ite folks er de town , suh . \"\nWarwick left the undertaker 's shop and retraced his steps until he had passed the lawyer 's office , toward which he threw an affectionate glance .\nA few rods farther led him past the old black Presbyterian church , with its square tower , embowered in a stately grove ; past the Catholic church , with its many crosses , and a painted wooden figure of St. James in a recess beneath the gable ; and past the old Jefferson House , once the leading hotel of the town , in front of which political meetings had been held , and political speeches made , and political hard cider drunk , in the days of \" Tippecanoe and Tyler too . \"\nThe street down which Warwick had come intersected Front Street at a sharp angle in front of the old hotel , forming a sort of flatiron block at the junction , known as Liberty Point , -- perhaps because slave auctions were sometimes held there in the good old days .\nJust before Warwick reached Liberty Point , a young woman came down Front Street from the direction of the market-house .\nWhen their paths converged , Warwick kept on down Front Street behind her , it having been already his intention to walk in this direction .\nWarwick 's first glance had revealed the fact that the young woman was strikingly handsome , with a stately beauty seldom encountered .\nAs he walked along behind her at a measured distance , he could not help noting the details that made up this pleasing impression , for his mind was singularly alive to beauty , in whatever embodiment .\nThe girl 's figure , he perceived , was admirably proportioned ; she was evidently at the period when the angles of childhood were rounding into the promising curves of adolescence .\nHer abundant hair , of a dark and glossy brown , was neatly plaited and coiled above an ivory column that rose straight from a pair of gently sloping shoulders , clearly outlined beneath the light muslin frock that covered them .\nHe could see that she was tastefully , though not richly , dressed , and that she walked with an elastic step that revealed a light heart and the vigor of perfect health .\nHer face , of course , he could not analyze , since he had caught only the one brief but convincing glimpse of it .\n",

    "I MAKING GOOD WITH MOTHER When men began to build cities vertically instead of horizontally there passed from our highways a picturesque figure , and from our language an expressive figure of speech .\nThat oily-tongued , persuasive , soft-stepping stranger in the rusty Prince Albert and the black string tie who had been wont to haunt our back steps and front offices with his carefully wrapped bundle , retreated in bewildered defeat before the clanging blows of steel on steel that meant the erection of the first twenty-story skyscraper .\n\" As slick , \" we used to say , \" as a lightning-rod agent . \"\nOf what use his wares on a building whose tower was robed in clouds and which used the chain lightning for a necklace ?\nThe Fourth Avenue antique dealer had another curio to add to his collection of andirons , knockers , snuff boxes and warming pans .\nBut even as this quaint figure vanished there sprang up a new and glittering one to take his place .\nHe stood framed in the great plate-glass window of the very building which had brought about the defeat of his predecessor .\nA miracle of close shaving his face was , and a marvel of immaculateness his linen .\nDapper he was , and dressy , albeit inclined to glittering effects and a certain plethory at the back of the neck .\nBack of him stood shining shapes that reflected his glory in enamel , and brass , and glass .\nHis language was floral , but choice ; his talk was of gearings and bearings and cylinders and magnetos ; his method differed from that of him who went before as the method of a skilled aëronaut differs from that of the man who goes over Niagara in a barrel .\nAnd as he multiplied and spread over the land we coined a new figure of speech .\n\" Smooth ! \" we chuckled .\n\" As smooth as an automobile salesman . \"\nBut even as we listened , fascinated by his fluent verbiage there grew within us a certain resentment .\nFamiliarity with his glittering wares bred a contempt of them , so that he fell to speaking of them as necessities instead of luxuries .\nHe juggled figures , and thought nothing of four of them in a row .\nWe looked at our five-thousand-dollar salary , so strangely shrunken and thin now , and even as we looked we saw that the method of the unctuous , anxious stranger had become antiquated in its turn .\nThen from his ashes emerged a new being .\nNeither urger nor spellbinder he .\nThe twentieth century was stamped across his brow , and on his lips was ever the word \" Service . \"\nSilent , courteous , watchful , alert , he listened , while you talked .\nHis method , in turn , made that of the silk-lined salesman sound like the hoarse hoots of the ballyhoo man at a county fair .\nBlithely he accepted five hundred thousand dollars and gave in return -- a promise .\nAnd when we would search our soul for a synonym to express all that was low-voiced , and suave , and judicious , and patient , and sure , we began to say , \" As alert as an advertising expert . \"\nJock McChesney , looking as fresh and clear-eyed as only twenty-one and a cold shower can make one look , stood in the doorway of his mother 's bedroom .\nHis toilette had halted abruptly at the bathrobe stage .\nOne of those bulky garments swathed his slim figure , while over his left arm hung a gray tweed Norfolk coat .\nFrom his right hand dangled a pair of trousers , in pattern a modish black-and-white .\nJock regarded the gray garment on his arm with moody eyes .\n\" Well , I 'd like to know what 's the matter with it ! \" he demanded , a trifle irritably .\nEmma McChesney , in the act of surveying her back hair in the mirror , paused , hand glass poised half way , to regard her son .\n\" All right , \" she answered cheerfully .\n\" I 'll tell you .\nIt 's too young . \"\n\" Young ! \"\nHe held it at arm 's length and stared at it .\n\" What d'you mean -- young ? \"\nEmma McChesney came forward , wrapping the folds of her kimono about her .\nShe took the disputed garment in one hand and held it aloft .\n\" I know that you look like a man on a magazine cover in it .\nBut Norfolk suits spell tennis , and seashore , and elegant leisure .\nAnd you 're going out this morning , Son , to interview business men .\nYou 're going to try to impress the advertising world with the fact that it needs your expert services .\nYou walk into a business office in a Norfolk suit , and everybody from the office boy to the president of the company will ask you what your score is . \"\nShe tossed it back over his arm .\n\" I 'll wear the black and white , \" said Jock resignedly , and turned toward his own room .\nAt his doorway he paused and raised his voice slightly : \" For that matter , they 're looking for young men .\nEverybody 's young .\nWhy , the biggest men in the advertising game are just kids . \"\nHe disappeared within his room , still talking .\n\" Look at McQuirk , advertising manager of the Combs Car Company .\nHe 's so young he has to disguise himself in bone-trimmed eye-glasses with a black ribbon to get away with it .\nLook at Hopper , of the Berg , Shriner Company .\nPulls down ninety thousand a year , and if he 's thirty-five I 'll -- \" \" Well , you asked my advice , \" interrupted his mother 's voice with that muffled effect which is caused by a skirt being slipped over the head , \" and I gave it .\nWear a white duck sailor suit with blue anchors and carry a red tin pail and a shovel , if you want to look young .\nOnly get into it in a jiffy , Son , because breakfast will be ready in ten minutes .\nI can tell by the way Annie 's crashing the cups .\nSo step lively if you want to pay your lovely mother 's subway fare . \"\nTen minutes later the slim young figure , in its English-fitting black and white , sat opposite Emma McChesney at the breakfast table and between excited gulps of coffee outlined a meteoric career in his chosen field .\nAnd the more he talked and the rosier his figures of speech became , the more silent and thoughtful fell his mother .\nShe wondered if five o'clock would find a droop to the set of those young shoulders ; if the springy young legs in their absurdly scant modish trousers would have lost some of their elasticity ; if the buoyant step in the flat-heeled shoes would not drag a little .\nThirteen years of business experience had taught her to swallow smilingly the bitter pill of rebuff .\nBut this boy was to experience his first dose to-day .\nShe felt again that sensation of almost physical nausea -- that sickness of heart and spirit which had come over her when she had met her first sneer and intolerant shrug .\nIt had been her maiden trip on the road for the T.A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company .\nShe was secretary of that company now , and moving spirit in its policy .\nBut the wound of that first insult still ached .\nA word from her would have placed the boy and saved him from curt refusals .\nShe withheld that word .\nHe must fight his fight alone .\n\" I want to write the kind of ad , \" Jock was saying excitedly , \" that you see 'em staring at in the subways , and street cars and L-trains .\nI want to sit across the aisle and watch their up-turned faces staring at that oblong , and reading it aloud to each other . \"\n\" Is n't that an awfully obvious necktie you 're wearing , Jock ? \" inquired his mother irrelevantly .\n\" This ?\nYou ought to see some of them .\nThis is a Quaker stock in comparison . \"\nHe glanced down complacently at the vivid-hued silken scarf that the season 's mode demanded .\nImmediately he was off again .\n\" And the first thing you know , Mrs. McChesney , ma'am , we 'll have a motor truck backing up at the door once a month and six strong men carrying my salary to the freight elevator in sacks . \"\nEmma McChesney buttered her bit of toast , then looked up to remark quietly : \" Had n't you better qualify for the trial heats , Jock , before you jump into the finals ? \"\n\" Trial heats ! \" sneered Jock .\n\" They 're poky .\nI want real money .\nNow !\nIt is n't enough to be just well-to-do in these days .\nIt needs money .\nI want to be rich !\nNot just prosperous , but rich !\nSo rich that I can let the bath soap float around in the water without any pricks of conscience .\nSo successful that they 'll say , ' And he 's a mere boy , too .\nImagine ! ' \"\nAnd , \" Jock dear , \" Emma McChesney said , \" you 've still to learn that plans and ambitions are like soap bubbles .\nThe harder you blow and the more you inflate them , the quicker they burst .\nPlans and ambitions are things to be kept locked away in your heart , Son , with no one but yourself to take an occasional peep at them . \"\nJock leaned over the table , with his charming smile .\n\" You 're a jealous blonde , \" he laughed .\n\" Because I 'm going to be a captain of finance -- an advertising wizard ; you 're afraid I 'll grab the glory all away from you . \"\n[ Illustration : \" ' You 're a jealous blond , ' he said \" ] Mrs. McChesney folded her napkin and rose .\nShe looked unbelievably young , and trim , and radiant , to be the mother of this boasting boy .\n\" I 'm not afraid , \" she drawled , a wicked little glint in her blue eyes .\n\" You see , they 'll only regard your feats and say , ' H 'm , no wonder .\nHe ought to be able to sell ice to an Eskimo .\nHis mother was Emma McChesney . ' \"\nAnd then , being a modern mother , she donned smart autumn hat and tailored suit coat and stood ready to reach her office by nine-thirty .\nBut because she was as motherly as she was modern she swung open the door between kitchen and dining-room to advise with Annie , the adept .\n\" Lamb chops to-night , eh , Annie ?\nAnd sweet potatoes .\nJock loves 'em .\nAnd corn au gratin and some head lettuce . \"\nShe glanced toward Jock in the hallway , then lowered her voice .\n\" Annie , \" she teased , \" just give us one of your peach cobblers , will you ?\nYou see he -- he 's going to be awfully -- tired when he gets home . \"\n",

    "CHAPTER I DESCRIPTION OF FARMER OAK -- AN INCIDENT When Farmer Oak smiled , the corners of his mouth spread till they were within an unimportant distance of his ears , his eyes were reduced to chinks , and diverging wrinkles appeared round them , extending upon his countenance like the rays in a rudimentary sketch of the rising sun .\nHis Christian name was Gabriel , and on working days he was a young man of sound judgment , easy motions , proper dress , and general good character .\nOn Sundays he was a man of misty views , rather given to postponing , and hampered by his best clothes and umbrella : upon the whole , one who felt himself to occupy morally that vast middle space of Laodicean neutrality which lay between the Communion people of the parish and the drunken section , -- that is , he went to church , but yawned privately by the time the con - gegation reached the Nicene creed , - and thought of what there would be for dinner when he meant to be listening to the sermon .\nOr , to state his character as it stood in the scale of public opinion , when his friends and critics were in tantrums , he was considered rather a bad man ; when they were pleased , he was rather a good man ; when they were neither , he was a man whose moral colour was a kind of pepper-and-salt mixture .\nSince he lived six times as many working-days as Sundays , Oak 's appearance in his old clothes was most peculiarly his own -- the mental picture formed by his neighbours in imagining him being always dressed in that way .\nHe wore a low-crowned felt hat , spread out at the base by tight jamming upon the head for security in high winds , and a coat like Dr. Johnson 's ; his lower extremities being encased in ordinary leather leggings and boots emphatically large , affording to each foot a roomy apartment so constructed that any wearer might stand in a river all day long and know nothing of damp -- their maker being a conscientious man who endeavoured to compensate for any weakness in his cut by unstinted dimension and solidity .\nMr. Oak carried about him , by way of watch , - what may be called a small silver clock ; in other words , it was a watch as to shape and intention , and a small clock as to size .\nThis instrument being several years older than Oak 's grandfather , had the peculiarity of going either too fast or not at all .\nThe smaller of its hands , too , occasionally slipped round on the pivot , and thus , though the minutes were told with precision , nobody could be quite certain of the hour they belonged to .\nThe stopping peculiarity of his watch Oak remedied by thumps and shakes , and he escaped any evil consequences from the other two defects by constant comparisons with and observations of the sun and stars , and by pressing his face close to the glass of his neighbours ' windows , till he could discern the hour marked by the green-faced timekeepers within .\nIt may be mentioned that Oak 's fob being difficult of access , by reason of its somewhat high situation in the waistband of his trousers ( which also lay at a remote height under his waistcoat ) , the watch was as a necessity pulled out by throwing the body to one side , compressing the mouth and face to a mere mass of ruddy flesh on account of the exertion , and drawing up the watch by its chain , like a bucket from a well .\nBut some thoughtfull persons , who had seen him walking across one of his fields on a certain December morning -- sunny and exceedingly mild -- might have regarded Gabriel Oak in other aspects than these .\nIn his face one might notice that many of the hues and curves of youth had tarried on to manhood : there even remained in his remoter crannies some relics of the boy .\nHis height and breadth would have been sufficient to make his presence imposing , had they been exhibited with due consideration .\nBut there is a way some men have , rural and urban alike , for which the mind is more responsible than flesh and sinew : it is a way of curtail - ing their dimensions by their manner of showing them .\nAnd from a quiet modesty that would have become a vestal which seemed continually to impress upon him that he had no great claim on the world 's room , Oak walked unassumingly and with a faintly perceptible bend , yet distinct from a bowing of the shoulders .\nThis may be said to be a defect in an individual if he depends for his valuation more upon his appearance than upon his capacity to wear well , which Oak did not .\nHe had just reached the time of life at which \" young \" is ceasing to be the prefix of \" man \" in speaking of one .\nHe was at the brightest period of masculine growth , for his intellect and his emotions were clearly separated : he had passed the time during which the influence of youth indiscriminately mingles them in the character of impulse , and he had not yet arrived at the stage wherein they become united again , in the character of prejudice , by the influence of a wife and family .\nIn short , he was twenty-eight , and a bachelor .\nThe field he was in this morning sloped to a ridge called Norcombe Hill .\nThrough a spur of this hill ran the highway between Emminster and Chalk - Newton .\nCasually glancing over the hedge , Oak saw coming down the incline before him an ornamental spring waggon , painted yellow and gaily marked , drawn by two horses , a waggoner walking alongside bearing a whip perpendicularly .\nThe waggon was laden with household goods and window plants , and on the apex of the whole sat a woman , \" young \" and attractive .\nGabriel had not beheld the sight for more than half a minute , when the vehicle was brought to a standstill just beneath his eyes .\n\" The tailboard of the waggon is gone , Miss. \" said the waggoner .\n\" Then I heard it fall . \"\nsaid the girl , in a soft , though not particularly low voice .\n\" I heard a noise I could not account for when we were coming up the hill . \"\n\" I 'll run back . \"\n\" Do . \"\nshe answered .\nThe sensible horses stood -- perfectly still , and the waggoner 's steps sank fainter and fainter in the distance .\nThe girl on the summit of the load sat motionless , surrounded by tables and chairs with their legs upwards , backed by an oak settle , and ornamented in front by pots of geraniums , myrtles , and cactuses , together with a caged canary -- all probably from the windows of the house just vacated .\nThere was also a cat in a willow basket , from the partly-opened lid of which she gazed with half-closed eyes , and affectionately-surveyed the small birds around .\nThe handsome girl waited for some time idly in her place , and the only sound heard in the stillness was the hopping of the canary up-and down the perches of its prison .\nThen she looked attentively downwards .\nIt was not at the bird , nor at the cat ; it was at an oblong package tied in paper , and lying between them .\nShe turned her head to learn if the waggoner were coming .\nHe was not yet in sight ; and her-eyes crept back to the package , her thoughts seeming to run upon what was inside it .\nAt length she drew the article into her lap , and untied the paper covering ; a small swing looking-glass was disclosed , in which she proceeded to survey herself attentively .\nShe parted her lips and smiled .\nIt was a fine morning , and the sun lighted up to a scarlet glow the crimson jacket she wore , and painted a soft lustre upon her bright face and dark hair .\nThe myrtles , geraniums , and cactuses packed around her were fresh and green , and at such a leafless season they invested the whole concern of horses , waggon , furniture , and girl with a peculiar vernal charm .\nWhat possessed her to indulge in such a performance in the sight of the sparrows , blackbirds , and unperceived farmer who were alone its spectators , -- whether the smile began as a factitious one , to test her capacity in that art , -- nobody knows ; it ended certainly in a real smile .\nShe blushed at herself , and seeing her reflection blush , blushed the more .\nThe change from the customary spot and necessary occasion of such an act -- from the dressing hour in a bedroom to a time of travelling out of doors -- lent to the idle deed a novelty it did not intrinsically possess .\nThe picture was a delicate one .\nWoman 's prescriptive infirmity had stalked into the sunlight , which had clothed it in the freshness of an originality .\nA cynical inference was irresistible by Gabriel Oak as he regarded the scene , generous though he fain would have been .\nThere was no necessity whatever for her looking in the glass .\nShe did not adjust her hat , or pat her hair , or press a dimple into shape , or do one thing to signify that any such intention had been her motive in taking up the glass .\nShe simply observed herself as a fair product of Nature in the feminine kind , her thoughts seeming to glide into far-off though likely dramas in which men would play a part -- vistas of probable triumphs -- the smiles being of a phase suggesting that hearts were imagined as lost and won .\nStill , this was but conjecture , and the whole series of actions was so idly put forth as to make it rash to assert that intention had any part in them at all .\nThe waggoner 's steps were heard returning .\nShe put the glass in the paper , and the whole again into its place .\nWhen the waggon had passed on , Gabriel withdrew from his point of espial , and descending into the road , followed the vehicle to the turnpike-gate some way beyond the bottom of the hill , where the object of his contemplation now halted for the payment of toll .\nAbout twenty steps still remained between him and the gate , when he heard a dispute .\nlt was a difference con - cerning twopence between the persons with the waggon and the man at the toll-bar .\n\" Mis ' ess 's niece is upon the top of the things , and she says that 's enough that I 've offered ye , you great miser , and she wo n't pay any more . \"\nThese were the waggoner 's words .\n\" Very well ; then mis ' ess 's niece ca n't pass . \"\nsaid the turnpike-keeper , closing the gate .\nOak looked from one to the other of the disputants , and fell into a reverie .\nThere was something in the tone of twopence remarkably insignificant .\nThreepence had a definite value as money -- it was an appreciable infringement on a day 's wages , and , as such , a higgling matter ; but twopence -- \" Here . \"\nhe said , stepping forward and handing twopence to the gatekeeper ; \" let the young woman pass . \"\nHe looked up at her then ; she heard his words , and looked down .\nGabriel 's features adhered throughout their form so exactly to the middle line between the beauty of St. John and the ugliness of Judas Iscariot , as represented in a window of the church he attended , that not a single lineament could be selected and called worthy either of distinction or notoriety .\nThe redjacketed and dark - haired maiden seemed to think so too , for she carelessly glanced over him , and told her man to drive on .\nShe might have looked her thanks to Gabriel on a minute scale , but she did not speak them ; more probably she felt none , for in gaining her a passage he had lost her her point , and we know how women take a favour of that kind .\nThe gatekeeper surveyed the retreating vehicle .\n\" That 's a handsome maid \" he said to Oak \" But she has her faults . \"\nsaid Gabriel .\n\" True , farmer . \"\n\" And the greatest of them is -- well , what it is always . \"\n\" Beating people down ?\nay , 't is so . \"\n\" O no . \"\n\" What , then ? \"\nGabriel , perhaps a little piqued by the comely traveller 's indifference , glanced back to where he had witnessed her performance over the hedge , and said , \" Vanity . \"\n",

    "LETTER I LADY HOWARD TO THE REV. MR. VILLARS Howard Grove , Kent .\nCAN any thing , my good Sir , be more painful to a friendly mind , than a necessity of communicating disagreeable intelligence ?\nIndeed it is sometimes difficult to determine , whether the relator or the receiver of evil tidings is most to be pitied .\nI have just had a letter from Madame Duval ; she is totally at a loss in what manner to behave ; she seems desirous to repair the wrongs she has done , yet wishes the world to believe her blameless .\nShe would fain cast upon another the odium of those misfortunes for which she alone is answerable .\nHer letter is violent , sometimes abusive , and that of you !\n- you , to whom she is under obligations which are greater even than her faults , but to whose advice she wickedly imputes all the sufferings of her much injured daughter , the late Lady Belmont .\nThe chief purport of her writing I will acquaint you with ; the letter itself is not worthy your notice .\nShe tells me that she has , for many years past , been in continual expectation of making a journey to England , which prevented her writing for information concerning this melancholy subject , by giving her hopes of making personal inquiries ; but family occurrences have still detained her in France , which country she now sees no prospect of quitting .\nShe has , therefore , lately used her utmost endeavors to obtain a faithful account of whatever related to her ill-advised daughter ; the result of which giving her some reason to apprehend , that , upon her death-bed , she bequeathed an infant orphan to the world , she most graciously says , that if you , with whom she understands the child is placed , will procure authentic proofs of its relationship to her , you may sent it to Paris , where she will properly provide for it .\nThis woman is , undoubtedly , at length , self-convicted of her most unnatural behaviour ; it is evident , from her writing , that she is still as vulgar and illiterate as when her first husband , Mr. Evelyn , had the weakness to marry her ; nor does she at all apologize for addressing herself to me , though I was only once in her company .\nHer letter has excited in my daughter Mirvan , a strong desire to be informed of the motives which induced Madame Duval to abandon the unfortunate Lady Belmont , at a time when a mother 's protection was peculiarly necessary for her peace and her reputation .\nNotwithstanding I was personally acquainted with all the parties concerned in that affair , the subject always appeared of too delicate a nature to be spoken of with the principals ; I can not , therefore , satisfy Mrs. Mirvan otherwise than by applying to you .\nBy saying that you may send the child , Madame Duval aims at conferring , where she most owes obligation .\nI pretend not to give you advice ; you , to whose generous protection this helpless orphan is indebted for every thing , are the best and only judge of what she ought to do ; but I am much concerned at the trouble and uneasiness which this unworthy woman may occasion you .\nMy daughter and my grandchild join with me in desiring to be most kindly remembered to the amiable girl ; and they bid me remind you , that the annual visit to Howard Grove , which we were formerly promised , has been discontinued for more than four years .\nI am , dear Sir , with great regard , Your most obedient friend and servant , M. HOWARD .\nLETTER II MR. VILLARS TO LADY HOWARD Berry Hill , Dorsetshire .\nYOUR Ladyship did but too well foresee the perplexity and uneasiness of which Madame Duval 's letter has been productive .\nHowever , I ought rather to be thankful that I have so many years remained unmolested , than repine at my present embarrassment ; since it proves , at least , that this wretched woman is at length awakened to remorse .\nIn regard to my answer , I must humbly request your Ladyship to write to this effect : \" That I would not , upon any account , intentionally offend Madame Duval ; but that I have weighty , nay unanswerable reasons for detaining her grand-daughter at present in England ; the principal of which is , that it was the earnest desire of one to whose will she owes implicit duty .\nMadame Duval may be assured , that she meets with the utmost attention and tenderness ; that her education , however short of my wishes , almost exceeds my abilities ; and I flatter myself , when the time arrives that she shall pay her duty to her grand-mother , Madame Duval will find no reason to be dissatisfied with what has been done for her . \"\nYour Ladyship will not , I am sure , be surprised at this answer .\nMadame Duval is by no means a proper companion or guardian for a young woman : she is at once uneducated and unprincipled ; ungentle in temper , and unamiable in her manners .\nI have long known that she has persuaded herself to harbour an aversion for me-Unhappy woman !\nI can only regard her as an object of pity !\nI dare not hesitate at a request from Mrs. Mirvan ; yet , in complying with it , I shall , for her own sake , be as concise as I possibly can ; since the cruel transactions which preceded the birth of my ward can afford no entertainment to a mind so humane as her 's .\nYour Ladyship may probably have heard , that I had the honour to accompany Mr. Evelyn , the grandfather of my young charge , when upon his travels , in the capacity of a tutor .\nHis unhappy marriage , immediately upon his return to England , with Madame Duval , then a waiting-girl at a tavern , contrary to the advice and entreaties of all his friends , among whom I was myself the most urgent , induced him to abandon his native land , and fix his abode in France .\nThither he was followed by shame and repentance ; feelings which his heart was not framed to support ; for , notwithstanding he had been too weak to resist the allurements of beauty , which nature , though a niggard to her of every other boon , had with a lavish hand bestowed on his wife ; yet he was a young man of excellent character , and , till thus unaccountably infatuated , of unblemished conduct .\nHe survived this ill-judged marriage but two years .\nUpon his death-bed , with an unsteady hand , he wrote me the following note : \" My friend , forget your resentment , in favour of your humanity ; - a father , trembling for the welfare of his child , bequeaths her to your care .\nO Villars !\nhear !\npity !\nAnd relieve me ! \"\nHad my circumstances permitted me , I should have answered these words by an immediate journey to Paris ; but I was obliged to act by the agency of a friend , who was upon the spot , and present at the opening of the will .\nMr. Evelyn left to me a legacy of a thousand pounds , and the sole guardianship of his daughter 's person till her eighteenth year ; conjuring me , in the most affecting terms , to take the charge of her education till she was able to act with propriety for herself ; but , in regard to fortune , he left her wholly dependent on her mother , to whose tenderness he earnestly recommended her .\nThus , though he would not , to a woman low-bred and illiberal as Mrs. Evelyn , trust the conduct and morals of his daughter , he nevertheless thought proper to secure to her the respect and duty to which , from her own child , were certainly her due ; but unhappily , it never occurred to him that the mother , on her part , could fail in affection or justice .\nMiss Evelyn , Madam , from the second to the eighteenth year of her life , was brought up under my care , and , except when at school under my roof .\nI need not speak to your Ladyship of the virtues of that excellent young creature .\nShe loved me as her father ; nor was Mrs. Villars less valued by her ; while to me she became so dear , that her loss was little less afflicting than that which I have since sustained of Mrs. Villars herself .\nAt that period of her life we parted ; her mother , then married to Monsieur Duval , sent for her to Paris .\nHow often have I since regretted that I did not accompany her thither !\nProtected and supported by me , the misery and disgrace which awaited her might perhaps have been avoided .\nBut , to be brief-Madame Duval , at the instigation of her husband , earnestly , or rather tyrannically , endeavoured to effect a union between Miss Evelyn and one of his nephews .\nAnd , when she found her power inadequate to her attempt , enraged at her non-compliance , she treated her with the grossest unkindness , and threatened her with poverty and ruin .\nMiss Evelyn , to whom wrath and violence had hitherto been strangers , soon grew weary of such usage ; and rashly , and without a witness , consented to a private marriage with Sir John Belmont , a very profligate young man , who had but too successfully found means to insinuate himself into her favour .\nHe promised to conduct her to England-he did.-O , Madam , you know the rest !\n- Disappointed of the fortune he expected , by the inexorable rancour of the Duvals , he infamously burnt the certificate of their marriage , and denied that they had ever been united .\nShe flew to me for protection .\nWith what mixed transports of joy and anguish did I again see her !\nBy my advice , she endeavoured to procure proofs of her marriage-but in vain ; her credulity had been no match for his art .\nEvery body believed her innocent , from the guiltless tenor of her unspotted youth , and from the known libertinism of her barbarous betrayer .\nYet her sufferings were too acute for her slender frame ; and the same moment that gave birth to her infant , put an end at once to the sorrows and the life of its mother .\nThe rage of Madame Duval at her elopement , abated not while this injured victim of cruelty yet drew breath .\nShe probably intended , in time , to have pardoned her ; but time was not allowed .\nWhen she was informed of her death , I have been told , that the agonies of grief and remorse , with which she was seized , occasioned her a severe fit of illness .\nBut , from the time of her recovery to the date of her letter to your Ladyship , I had never heard that she manifested any desire to be made acquainted with the circumstances which attended the death of Lady Belmont , and the birth of her helpless child .\n",

    "_ One _ DREAMS Night fell .\nThe red waters of the swamp grew sinister and sullen .\nThe tall pines lost their slimness and stood in wide blurred blotches all across the way , and a great shadowy bird arose , wheeled and melted , murmuring , into the black-green sky .\nThe boy wearily dropped his heavy bundle and stood still , listening as the voice of crickets split the shadows and made the silence audible .\nA tear wandered down his brown cheek .\nThey were at supper now , he whispered -- the father and old mother , away back yonder beyond the night .\nThey were far away ; they would never be as near as once they had been , for he had stepped into the world .\nAnd the cat and Old Billy -- ah , but the world was a lonely thing , so wide and tall and empty !\nAnd so bare , so bitter bare !\nSomehow he had never dreamed of the world as lonely before ; he had fared forth to beckoning hands and luring , and to the eager hum of human voices , as of some great , swelling music .\nYet now he was alone ; the empty night was closing all about him here in a strange land , and he was afraid .\nThe bundle with his earthly treasure had hung heavy and heavier on his shoulder ; his little horde of money was tightly wadded in his sock , and the school lay hidden somewhere far away in the shadows .\nHe wondered how far it was ; he looked and harkened , starting at his own heartbeats , and fearing more and more the long dark fingers of the night .\nThen of a sudden up from the darkness came music .\nIt was human music , but of a wildness and a weirdness that startled the boy as it fluttered and danced across the dull red waters of the swamp .\nHe hesitated , then impelled by some strange power , left the highway and slipped into the forest of the swamp , shrinking , yet following the song hungrily and half forgetting his fear .\nA harsher , shriller note struck in as of many and ruder voices ; but above it flew the first sweet music , birdlike , abandoned , and the boy crept closer .\nThe cabin crouched ragged and black at the edge of black waters .\nAn old chimney leaned drunkenly against it , raging with fire and smoke , while through the chinks winked red gleams of warmth and wild cheer .\nWith a revel of shouting and noise , the music suddenly ceased .\nHoarse staccato cries and peals of laughter shook the old hut , and as the boy stood there peering through the black trees , abruptly the door flew open and a flood of light illumined the wood .\nAmid this mighty halo , as on clouds of flame , a girl was dancing .\nShe was black , and lithe , and tall , and willowy .\nHer garments twined and flew around the delicate moulding of her dark , young , half-naked limbs .\nA heavy mass of hair clung motionless to her wide forehead .\nHer arms twirled and flickered , and body and soul seemed quivering and whirring in the poetry of her motion .\nAs she danced she sang .\nHe heard her voice as before , fluttering like a bird 's in the full sweetness of her utter music .\nIt was no tune nor melody , it was just formless , boundless music .\nThe boy forgot himself and all the world besides .\nAll his darkness was sudden light ; dazzled he crept forward , bewildered , fascinated , until with one last wild whirl the elf-girl paused .\nThe crimson light fell full upon the warm and velvet bronze of her face -- her midnight eyes were aglow , her full purple lips apart , her half hid bosom panting , and all the music dead .\nInvoluntarily the boy gave a gasping cry and awoke to swamp and night and fire , while a white face , drawn , red-eyed , peered outward from some hidden throng within the cabin .\n\" Who 's that ? \" a harsh voice cried .\n\" Where ? \"\n\" Who is it ? \" and pale crowding faces blurred the light .\nThe boy wheeled blindly and fled in terror stumbling through the swamp , hearing strange sounds and feeling stealthy creeping hands and arms and whispering voices .\nOn he toiled in mad haste , struggling toward the road and losing it until finally beneath the shadows of a mighty oak he sank exhausted .\nThere he lay a while trembling and at last drifted into dreamless sleep .\nIt was morning when he awoke and threw a startled glance upward to the twisted branches of the oak that bent above , sifting down sunshine on his brown face and close curled hair .\nSlowly he remembered the loneliness , the fear and wild running through the dark .\nHe laughed in the bold courage of day and stretched himself .\nThen suddenly he bethought him again of that vision of the night -- the waving arms and flying limbs of the girl , and her great black eyes looking into the night and calling him .\nHe could hear her now , and hear that wondrous savage music .\nHad it been real ?\nHad he dreamed ?\nOr had it been some witch-vision of the night , come to tempt and lure him to his undoing ?\nWhere was that black and flaming cabin ?\nWhere was the girl -- the soul that had called him ?\n_ She _ must have been real ; she had to live and dance and sing ; he must again look into the mystery of her great eyes .\nAnd he sat up in sudden determination , and , lo !\ngazed straight into the very eyes of his dreaming .\nShe sat not four feet from him , leaning against the great tree , her eyes now languorously abstracted , now alert and quizzical with mischief .\nShe seemed but half-clothed , and her warm , dark flesh peeped furtively through the rent gown ; her thick , crisp hair was frowsy and rumpled , and the long curves of her bare young arms gleamed in the morning sunshine , glowing with vigor and life .\nA little mocking smile came and sat upon her lips .\n\" What you run for ? \" she asked , with dancing mischief in her eyes .\n\" Because -- \" he hesitated , and his cheeks grew hot .\n\" I knows , \" she said , with impish glee , laughing low music .\n\" Why ? \" he challenged , sturdily .\n\" You was a-feared . \"\nHe bridled .\n\" Well , I reckon you 'd be a-feared if you was caught out in the black dark all alone . \"\n\" Pooh ! \" she scoffed and hugged her knees .\n\" Pooh !\nI 've stayed out all alone heaps o ' nights . \"\nHe looked at her with a curious awe .\n\" I do n't believe you , \" he asserted ; but she tossed her head and her eyes grew scornful .\n\" Who 's a-feared of the dark ?\nI love night . \"\nHer eyes grew soft .\nHe watched her silently , till , waking from her daydream , she abruptly asked : \" Where you from ? \"\n\" Georgia . \"\n\" Where 's that ? \"\nHe looked at her in surprise , but she seemed matter-of-fact .\n\" It 's away over yonder , \" he answered .\n\" Behind where the sun comes up ? \"\n\" Oh , no ! \"\n\" Then it ai n't so far , \" she declared .\n\" I knows where the sun rises , and I knows where it sets . \"\nShe looked up at its gleaming splendor glinting through the leaves , and , noting its height , announced abruptly : \" I ' se hungry . \"\n\" So 'm I , \" answered the boy , fumbling at his bundle ; and then , timidly : \" Will you eat with me ? \"\n\" Yes , \" she said , and watched him with eager eyes .\nUntying the strips of cloth , he opened his box , and disclosed chicken and biscuits , ham and corn-bread .\nShe clapped her hands in glee .\n\" Is there any water near ? \" he asked .\nWithout a word , she bounded up and flitted off like a brown bird , gleaming dull-golden in the sun , glancing in and out among the trees , till she paused above a tiny black pool , and then came tripping and swaying back with hands held cupwise and dripping with cool water .\n\" Drink , \" she cried .\nObediently he bent over the little hands that seemed so soft and thin .\nHe took a deep draught ; and then to drain the last drop , his hands touched hers and the shock of flesh first meeting flesh startled them both , while the water rained through .\nA moment their eyes looked deep into each other 's -- a timid , startled gleam in hers ; a wonder in his .\nThen she said dreamily : \" We ' se known us all our lives , and -- before , ai n't we ? \"\nHe hesitated .\n\" Ye -- es -- I reckon , \" he slowly returned .\nAnd then , brightening , he asked gayly : \" And we 'll be friends always , wo n't we ? \"\n\" Yes , \" she said at last , slowly and solemnly , and another brief moment they stood still .\nThen the mischief danced in her eyes , and a song bubbled on her lips .\nShe hopped to the tree .\n\" Come -- eat ! \" she cried .\nAnd they nestled together amid the big black roots of the oak , laughing and talking while they ate .\n\" What 's over there ? \" he asked pointing northward .\n\" Cresswell 's big house . \"\n\" And yonder to the west ? \"\n\" The school . \"\nHe started joyfully .\n\" The school !\nWhat school ? \"\n\" Old Miss ' School . \"\n\" Miss Smith 's school ? \"\n\" Yes . \"\nThe tone was disdainful .\n\" Why , that 's where I 'm going .\nI was a-feared it was a long way off ; I must have passed it in the night . \"\n\" I hate it ! \" cried the girl , her lips tense .\n\" But I 'll be so near , \" he explained .\n\" And why do you hate it ? \"\n\" Yes -- you 'll be near , \" she admitted ; \" that 'll be nice ; but -- \" she glanced westward , and the fierce look faded .\nSoft joy crept to her face again , and she sat once more dreaming .\n\" Yon way 's nicest , \" she said .\n\" Why , what 's there ? \"\n\" The swamp , \" she said mysteriously .\n\" And what 's beyond the swamp ? \"\nShe crouched beside him and whispered in eager , tense tones : \" Dreams ! \"\nHe looked at her , puzzled .\n",

    "CHAPTER I In the days when the spinning-wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses -- and even great ladies , clothed in silk and thread-lace , had their toy spinning-wheels of polished oak -- there might be seen in districts far away among the lanes , or deep in the bosom of the hills , certain pallid undersized men , who , by the side of the brawny country-folk , looked like the remnants of a disinherited race .\nThe shepherd 's dog barked fiercely when one of these alien-looking men appeared on the upland , dark against the early winter sunset ; for what dog likes a figure bent under a heavy bag ?\n-- and these pale men rarely stirred abroad without that mysterious burden .\nThe shepherd himself , though he had good reason to believe that the bag held nothing but flaxen thread , or else the long rolls of strong linen spun from that thread , was not quite sure that this trade of weaving , indispensable though it was , could be carried on entirely without the help of the Evil One .\nIn that far-off time superstition clung easily round every person or thing that was at all unwonted , or even intermittent and occasional merely , like the visits of the pedlar or the knife-grinder .\nNo one knew where wandering men had their homes or their origin ; and how was a man to be explained unless you at least knew somebody who knew his father and mother ?\nTo the peasants of old times , the world outside their own direct experience was a region of vagueness and mystery : to their untravelled thought a state of wandering was a conception as dim as the winter life of the swallows that came back with the spring ; and even a settler , if he came from distant parts , hardly ever ceased to be viewed with a remnant of distrust , which would have prevented any surprise if a long course of inoffensive conduct on his part had ended in the commission of a crime ; especially if he had any reputation for knowledge , or showed any skill in handicraft .\nAll cleverness , whether in the rapid use of that difficult instrument the tongue , or in some other art unfamiliar to villagers , was in itself suspicious : honest folk , born and bred in a visible manner , were mostly not overwise or clever -- at least , not beyond such a matter as knowing the signs of the weather ; and the process by which rapidity and dexterity of any kind were acquired was so wholly hidden , that they partook of the nature of conjuring .\nIn this way it came to pass that those scattered linen-weavers -- emigrants from the town into the country -- were to the last regarded as aliens by their rustic neighbours , and usually contracted the eccentric habits which belong to a state of loneliness .\nIn the early years of this century , such a linen-weaver , named Silas Marner , worked at his vocation in a stone cottage that stood among the nutty hedgerows near the village of Raveloe , and not far from the edge of a deserted stone-pit .\nThe questionable sound of Silas 's loom , so unlike the natural cheerful trotting of the winnowing-machine , or the simpler rhythm of the flail , had a half-fearful fascination for the Raveloe boys , who would often leave off their nutting or birds ' - nesting to peep in at the window of the stone cottage , counterbalancing a certain awe at the mysterious action of the loom , by a pleasant sense of scornful superiority , drawn from the mockery of its alternating noises , along with the bent , tread-mill attitude of the weaver .\nBut sometimes it happened that Marner , pausing to adjust an irregularity in his thread , became aware of the small scoundrels , and , though chary of his time , he liked their intrusion so ill that he would descend from his loom , and , opening the door , would fix on them a gaze that was always enough to make them take to their legs in terror .\nFor how was it possible to believe that those large brown protuberant eyes in Silas Marner 's pale face really saw nothing very distinctly that was not close to them , and not rather that their dreadful stare could dart cramp , or rickets , or a wry mouth at any boy who happened to be in the rear ?\nThey had , perhaps , heard their fathers and mothers hint that Silas Marner could cure folks ' rheumatism if he had a mind , and add , still more darkly , that if you could only speak the devil fair enough , he might save you the cost of the doctor .\nSuch strange lingering echoes of the old demon-worship might perhaps even now be caught by the diligent listener among the grey-haired peasantry ; for the rude mind with difficulty associates the ideas of power and benignity .\nA shadowy conception of power that by much persuasion can be induced to refrain from inflicting harm , is the shape most easily taken by the sense of the Invisible in the minds of men who have always been pressed close by primitive wants , and to whom a life of hard toil has never been illuminated by any enthusiastic religious faith .\nTo them pain and mishap present a far wider range of possibilities than gladness and enjoyment : their imagination is almost barren of the images that feed desire and hope , but is all overgrown by recollections that are a perpetual pasture to fear .\n\" Is there anything you can fancy that you would like to eat ? \"\nI once said to an old labouring man , who was in his last illness , and who had refused all the food his wife had offered him .\n\" No , \" he answered , \" I 've never been used to nothing but common victual , and I ca n't eat that . \"\nExperience had bred no fancies in him that could raise the phantasm of appetite .\nAnd Raveloe was a village where many of the old echoes lingered , undrowned by new voices .\nNot that it was one of those barren parishes lying on the outskirts of civilization -- inhabited by meagre sheep and thinly-scattered shepherds : on the contrary , it lay in the rich central plain of what we are pleased to call Merry England , and held farms which , speaking from a spiritual point of view , paid highly-desirable tithes .\nBut it was nestled in a snug well-wooded hollow , quite an hour 's journey on horseback from any turnpike , where it was never reached by the vibrations of the coach-horn , or of public opinion .\nIt was an important-looking village , with a fine old church and large churchyard in the heart of it , and two or three large brick-and-stone homesteads , with well-walled orchards and ornamental weathercocks , standing close upon the road , and lifting more imposing fronts than the rectory , which peeped from among the trees on the other side of the churchyard : -- a village which showed at once the summits of its social life , and told the practised eye that there was no great park and manor-house in the vicinity , but that there were several chiefs in Raveloe who could farm badly quite at their ease , drawing enough money from their bad farming , in those war times , to live in a rollicking fashion , and keep a jolly Christmas , Whitsun , and Easter tide .\nIt was fifteen years since Silas Marner had first come to Raveloe ; he was then simply a pallid young man , with prominent short-sighted brown eyes , whose appearance would have had nothing strange for people of average culture and experience , but for the villagers near whom he had come to settle it had mysterious peculiarities which corresponded with the exceptional nature of his occupation , and his advent from an unknown region called \" North ' ard \" .\nSo had his way of life : -- he invited no comer to step across his door-sill , and he never strolled into the village to drink a pint at the Rainbow , or to gossip at the wheelwright 's : he sought no man or woman , save for the purposes of his calling , or in order to supply himself with necessaries ; and it was soon clear to the Raveloe lasses that he would never urge one of them to accept him against her will -- quite as if he had heard them declare that they would never marry a dead man come to life again .\nThis view of Marner 's personality was not without another ground than his pale face and unexampled eyes ; for Jem Rodney , the mole-catcher , averred that one evening as he was returning homeward , he saw Silas Marner leaning against a stile with a heavy bag on his back , instead of resting the bag on the stile as a man in his senses would have done ; and that , on coming up to him , he saw that Marner 's eyes were set like a dead man 's , and he spoke to him , and shook him , and his limbs were stiff , and his hands clutched the bag as if they 'd been made of iron ; but just as he had made up his mind that the weaver was dead , he came all right again , like , as you might say , in the winking of an eye , and said \" Good-night \" , and walked off .\nAll this Jem swore he had seen , more by token that it was the very day he had been mole-catching on Squire Cass 's land , down by the old saw-pit .\nSome said Marner must have been in a \" fit \" , a word which seemed to explain things otherwise incredible ; but the argumentative Mr. Macey , clerk of the parish , shook his head , and asked if anybody was ever known to go off in a fit and not fall down .\nA fit was a stroke , was n't it ?\nand it was in the nature of a stroke to partly take away the use of a man 's limbs and throw him on the parish , if he 'd got no children to look to .\nNo , no ; it was no stroke that would let a man stand on his legs , like a horse between the shafts , and then walk off as soon as you can say \" Gee ! \"\nBut there might be such a thing as a man 's soul being loose from his body , and going out and in , like a bird out of its nest and back ; and that was how folks got over-wise , for they went to school in this shell-less state to those who could teach them more than their neighbours could learn with their five senses and the parson .\nAnd where did Master Marner get his knowledge of herbs from -- and charms too , if he liked to give them away ?\nJem Rodney 's story was no more than what might have been expected by anybody who had seen how Marner had cured Sally Oates , and made her sleep like a baby , when her heart had been beating enough to burst her body , for two months and more , while she had been under the doctor 's care .\nHe might cure more folks if he would ; but he was worth speaking fair , if it was only to keep him from doing you a mischief .\n",

    "Book First I Strether 's first question , when he reached the hotel , was about his friend ; yet on his learning that Waymarsh was apparently not to arrive till evening he was not wholly disconcerted .\nA telegram from him bespeaking a room \" only if not noisy , \" reply paid , was produced for the enquirer at the office , so that the understanding they should meet at Chester rather than at Liverpool remained to that extent sound .\nThe same secret principle , however , that had prompted Strether not absolutely to desire Waymarsh 's presence at the dock , that had led him thus to postpone for a few hours his enjoyment of it , now operated to make him feel he could still wait without disappointment .\nThey would dine together at the worst , and , with all respect to dear old Waymarsh -- if not even , for that matter , to himself -- there was little fear that in the sequel they should n't see enough of each other .\nThe principle I have just mentioned as operating had been , with the most newly disembarked of the two men , wholly instinctive -- the fruit of a sharp sense that , delightful as it would be to find himself looking , after so much separation , into his comrade 's face , his business would be a trifle bungled should he simply arrange for this countenance to present itself to the nearing steamer as the first \" note , \" of Europe .\nMixed with everything was the apprehension , already , on Strether 's part , that it would , at best , throughout , prove the note of Europe in quite a sufficient degree .\nThat note had been meanwhile -- since the previous afternoon , thanks to this happier device -- such a consciousness of personal freedom as he had n't known for years ; such a deep taste of change and of having above all for the moment nobody and nothing to consider , as promised already , if headlong hope were not too foolish , to colour his adventure with cool success .\nThere were people on the ship with whom he had easily consorted -- so far as ease could up to now be imputed to him -- and who for the most part plunged straight into the current that set from the landing-stage to London ; there were others who had invited him to a tryst at the inn and had even invoked his aid for a \" look round \" at the beauties of Liverpool ; but he had stolen away from every one alike , had kept no appointment and renewed no acquaintance , had been indifferently aware of the number of persons who esteemed themselves fortunate in being , unlike himself , \" met , \" and had even independently , unsociably , alone , without encounter or relapse and by mere quiet evasion , given his afternoon and evening to the immediate and the sensible .\nThey formed a qualified draught of Europe , an afternoon and an evening on the banks of the Mersey , but such as it was he took his potion at least undiluted .\nHe winced a little , truly , at the thought that Waymarsh might be already at Chester ; he reflected that , should he have to describe himself there as having \" got in \" so early , it would be difficult to make the interval look particularly eager ; but he was like a man who , elatedly finding in his pocket more money than usual , handles it a while and idly and pleasantly chinks it before addressing himself to the business of spending .\nThat he was prepared to be vague to Waymarsh about the hour of the ship 's touching , and that he both wanted extremely to see him and enjoyed extremely the duration of delay -- these things , it is to be conceived , were early signs in him that his relation to his actual errand might prove none of the simplest .\nHe was burdened , poor Strether -- it had better be confessed at the outset -- with the oddity of a double consciousness .\nThere was detachment in his zeal and curiosity in his indifference .\nAfter the young woman in the glass cage had held up to him across her counter the pale-pink leaflet bearing his friend 's name , which she neatly pronounced , he turned away to find himself , in the hall , facing a lady who met his eyes as with an intention suddenly determined , and whose features -- not freshly young , not markedly fine , but on happy terms with each other -- came back to him as from a recent vision .\nFor a moment they stood confronted ; then the moment placed her : he had noticed her the day before , noticed her at his previous inn , where -- again in the hall -- she had been briefly engaged with some people of his own ship 's company .\nNothing had actually passed between them , and he would as little have been able to say what had been the sign of her face for him on the first occasion as to name the ground of his present recognition .\nRecognition at any rate appeared to prevail on her own side as well -- which would only have added to the mystery .\nAll she now began by saying to him nevertheless was that , having chanced to catch his enquiry , she was moved to ask , by his leave , if it were possibly a question of Mr. Waymarsh of Milrose Connecticut -- Mr. Waymarsh the American lawyer .\n\" Oh yes , \" he replied , \" my very well-known friend .\nHe 's to meet me here , coming up from Malvern , and I supposed he 'd already have arrived .\nBut he does n't come till later , and I 'm relieved not to have kept him .\nDo you know him ? \"\nStrether wound up .\nIt was n't till after he had spoken that he became aware of how much there had been in him of response ; when the tone of her own rejoinder , as well as the play of something more in her face -- something more , that is , than its apparently usual restless light -- seemed to notify him .\n\" I 've met him at Milrose -- where I used sometimes , a good while ago , to stay ; I had friends there who were friends of his , and I 've been at his house .\nI wo n't answer for it that he would know me , \" Strether 's new acquaintance pursued ; \" but I should be delighted to see him .\nPerhaps , \" she added , \" I shall -- for I 'm staying over . \"\nShe paused while our friend took in these things , and it was as if a good deal of talk had already passed .\nThey even vaguely smiled at it , and Strether presently observed that Mr. Waymarsh would , no doubt , be easily to be seen .\nThis , however , appeared to affect the lady as if she might have advanced too far .\nShe appeared to have no reserves about anything .\n\" Oh , \" she said , \" he wo n't care ! \"\n-- and she immediately thereupon remarked that she believed Strether knew the Munsters ; the Munsters being the people he had seen her with at Liverpool .\nBut he did n't , it happened , know the Munsters well enough to give the case much of a lift ; so that they were left together as if over the mere laid table of conversation .\nHer qualification of the mentioned connexion had rather removed than placed a dish , and there seemed nothing else to serve .\nTheir attitude remained , none the less , that of not forsaking the board ; and the effect of this in turn was to give them the appearance of having accepted each other with an absence of preliminaries practically complete .\nThey moved along the hall together , and Strether 's companion threw off that the hotel had the advantage of a garden .\nHe was aware by this time of his strange inconsequence : he had shirked the intimacies of the steamer and had muffled the shock of Waymarsh only to find himself forsaken , in this sudden case , both of avoidance and of caution .\nHe passed , under this unsought protection and before he had so much as gone up to his room , into the garden of the hotel , and at the end of ten minutes had agreed to meet there again , as soon as he should have made himself tidy , the dispenser of such good assurances .\nHe wanted to look at the town , and they would forthwith look together .\nIt was almost as if she had been in possession and received him as a guest .\nHer acquaintance with the place presented her in a manner as a hostess , and Strether had a rueful glance for the lady in the glass cage .\nIt was as if this personage had seen herself instantly superseded .\nWhen in a quarter of an hour he came down , what his hostess saw , what she might have taken in with a vision kindly adjusted , was the lean , the slightly loose figure of a man of the middle height and something more perhaps than the middle age -- a man of five-and-fifty , whose most immediate signs were a marked bloodless brownness of face , a thick dark moustache , of characteristically American cut , growing strong and falling low , a head of hair still abundant but irregularly streaked with grey , and a nose of bold free prominence , the even line , the high finish , as it might have been called , of which , had a certain effect of mitigation .\nA perpetual pair of glasses astride of this fine ridge , and a line , unusually deep and drawn , the prolonged pen-stroke of time , accompanying the curve of the moustache from nostril to chin , did something to complete the facial furniture that an attentive observer would have seen catalogued , on the spot , in the vision of the other party to Strether 's appointment .\nShe waited for him in the garden , the other party , drawing on a pair of singularly fresh soft and elastic light gloves and presenting herself with a superficial readiness which , as he approached her over the small smooth lawn and in the watery English sunshine , he might , with his rougher preparation , have marked as the model for such an occasion .\nShe had , this lady , a perfect plain propriety , an expensive subdued suitability , that her companion was not free to analyse , but that struck him , so that his consciousness of it was instantly acute , as a quality quite new to him .\nBefore reaching her he stopped on the grass and went through the form of feeling for something , possibly forgotten , in the light overcoat he carried on his arm ; yet the essence of the act was no more than the impulse to gain time .\nNothing could have been odder than Strether 's sense of himself as at that moment launched in something of which the sense would be quite disconnected from the sense of his past and which was literally beginning there and then .\nIt had begun in fact already upstairs and before the dressing glass that struck him as blocking further , so strangely , the dimness of the window of his dull bedroom ; begun with a sharper survey of the elements of Appearance than he had for a long time been moved to make .\nHe had during those moments felt these elements to be not so much to his hand as he should have liked , and then had fallen back on the thought that they were precisely a matter as to which help was supposed to come from what he was about to do .\nHe was about to go up to London , so that hat and necktie might wait .\nWhat had come as straight to him as a ball in a well-played game -- and caught moreover not less neatly -- was just the air , in the person of his friend , of having seen and chosen , the air of achieved possession of those vague qualities and quantities that collectively figured to him as the advantage snatched from lucky chances .\nWithout pomp or circumstance , certainly , as her original address to him , equally with his own response , had been , he would have sketched to himself his impression of her as : \" Well , she 's more thoroughly civilized -- ! \"\nIf \" More thoroughly than WHOM ? \"\nwould not have been for him a sequel to this remark , that was just by reason of his deep consciousness of the bearing of his comparison .\n",

    "ADVENTURE I .\nA SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA I. To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman .\nI have seldom heard him mention her under any other name .\nIn his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex .\nIt was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler .\nAll emotions , and that one particularly , were abhorrent to his cold , precise but admirably balanced mind .\nHe was , I take it , the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen , but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position .\nHe never spoke of the softer passions , save with a gibe and a sneer .\nThey were admirable things for the observer -- excellent for drawing the veil from men 's motives and actions .\nBut for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results .\nGrit in a sensitive instrument , or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses , would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his .\nAnd yet there was but one woman to him , and that woman was the late Irene Adler , of dubious and questionable memory .\nI had seen little of Holmes lately .\nMy marriage had drifted us away from each other .\nMy own complete happiness , and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment , were sufficient to absorb all my attention , while Holmes , who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul , remained in our lodgings in Baker Street , buried among his old books , and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition , the drowsiness of the drug , and the fierce energy of his own keen nature .\nHe was still , as ever , deeply attracted by the study of crime , and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues , and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police .\nFrom time to time I heard some vague account of his doings : of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder , of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee , and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland .\nBeyond these signs of his activity , however , which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press , I knew little of my former friend and companion .\nOne night -- it was on the twentieth of March , 1888 -- I was returning from a journey to a patient ( for I had now returned to civil practice ) , when my way led me through Baker Street .\nAs I passed the well-remembered door , which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing , and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet , I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again , and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers .\nHis rooms were brilliantly lit , and , even as I looked up , I saw his tall , spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind .\nHe was pacing the room swiftly , eagerly , with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him .\nTo me , who knew his every mood and habit , his attitude and manner told their own story .\nHe was at work again .\nHe had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem .\nI rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own .\nHis manner was not effusive .\nIt seldom was ; but he was glad , I think , to see me .\nWith hardly a word spoken , but with a kindly eye , he waved me to an armchair , threw across his case of cigars , and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner .\nThen he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion .\n\" Wedlock suits you , \" he remarked .\n\" I think , Watson , that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you . \"\n\" Seven ! \"\nI answered .\n\" Indeed , I should have thought a little more .\nJust a trifle more , I fancy , Watson .\nAnd in practice again , I observe .\nYou did not tell me that you intended to go into harness . \"\n\" Then , how do you know ? \"\n\" I see it , I deduce it .\nHow do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately , and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl ? \"\n\" My dear Holmes , \" said I , \" this is too much .\nYou would certainly have been burned , had you lived a few centuries ago .\nIt is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess , but as I have changed my clothes I ca n't imagine how you deduce it .\nAs to Mary Jane , she is incorrigible , and my wife has given her notice , but there , again , I fail to see how you work it out . \"\nHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long , nervous hands together .\n\" It is simplicity itself , \" said he ; \" my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe , just where the firelight strikes it , the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts .\nObviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it .\nHence , you see , my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather , and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey .\nAs to your practice , if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform , with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger , and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope , I must be dull , indeed , if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession . \"\nI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction .\n\" When I hear you give your reasons , \" I remarked , \" the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself , though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process .\nAnd yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours . \"\n\" Quite so , \" he answered , lighting a cigarette , and throwing himself down into an armchair .\n\" You see , but you do not observe .\nThe distinction is clear .\nFor example , you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room . \"\n\" Frequently . \"\n\" How often ? \"\n\" Well , some hundreds of times . \"\n\" Then how many are there ? \"\n\" How many ?\nI do n't know . \"\n\" Quite so !\nYou have not observed .\nAnd yet you have seen .\nThat is just my point .\nNow , I know that there are seventeen steps , because I have both seen and observed .\nBy-the-way , since you are interested in these little problems , and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences , you may be interested in this . \"\nHe threw over a sheet of thick , pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table .\n\" It came by the last post , \" said he .\n\" Read it aloud . \"\nThe note was undated , and without either signature or address .\n\" There will call upon you to-night , at a quarter to eight o'clock , \" it said , \" a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment .\nYour recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated .\nThis account of you we have from all quarters received .\nBe in your chamber then at that hour , and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask . \"\n\" This is indeed a mystery , \" I remarked .\n\" What do you imagine that it means ? \"\n\" I have no data yet .\nIt is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data .\nInsensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories , instead of theories to suit facts .\nBut the note itself .\nWhat do you deduce from it ? \"\nI carefully examined the writing , and the paper upon which it was written .\n\" The man who wrote it was presumably well to do , \" I remarked , endeavouring to imitate my companion 's processes .\n\" Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet .\nIt is peculiarly strong and stiff . \"\n\" Peculiar -- that is the very word , \" said Holmes .\n\" It is not an English paper at all .\nHold it up to the light . \"\nI did so , and saw a large \" E \" with a small \" g , \" a \" P , \" and a large \" G \" with a small \" t \" woven into the texture of the paper .\n\" What do you make of that ? \" asked Holmes .\n\" The name of the maker , no doubt ; or his monogram , rather . \"\n\" Not at all .\nThe ' G ' with the small ' t ' stands for ' Gesellschaft , ' which is the German for ' Company . '\nIt is a customary contraction like our ' Co. ' ' P , ' of course , stands for ' Papier . '\nNow for the ' Eg . '\nLet us glance at our Continental Gazetteer . \"\nHe took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves .\n\" Eglow , Eglonitz -- here we are , Egria .\nIt is in a German-speaking country -- in Bohemia , not far from Carlsbad .\n' Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein , and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills . '\nHa , ha , my boy , what do you make of that ? \"\nHis eyes sparkled , and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette .\n\" The paper was made in Bohemia , \" I said .\n\" Precisely .\nAnd the man who wrote the note is a German .\nDo you note the peculiar construction of the sentence -- ' This account of you we have from all quarters received . '\nA Frenchman or Russian could not have written that .\nIt is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs .\nIt only remains , therefore , to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face .\nAnd here he comes , if I am not mistaken , to resolve all our doubts . \"\n",

    "Chapter I. Into the Primitive “ Old longings nomadic leap , Chafing at custom 's chain ; Again from its brumal sleep Wakens the ferine strain . ”\nBuck did not read the newspapers , or he would have known that trouble was brewing , not alone for himself , but for every tide-water dog , strong of muscle and with warm , long hair , from Puget Sound to San Diego .\nBecause men , groping in the Arctic darkness , had found a yellow metal , and because steamship and transportation companies were booming the find , thousands of men were rushing into the Northland .\nThese men wanted dogs , and the dogs they wanted were heavy dogs , with strong muscles by which to toil , and furry coats to protect them from the frost .\nBuck lived at a big house in the sun-kissed Santa Clara Valley .\nJudge Miller 's place , it was called .\nIt stood back from the road , half hidden among the trees , through which glimpses could be caught of the wide cool veranda that ran around its four sides .\nThe house was approached by gravelled driveways which wound about through wide-spreading lawns and under the interlacing boughs of tall poplars .\nAt the rear things were on even a more spacious scale than at the front .\nThere were great stables , where a dozen grooms and boys held forth , rows of vine-clad servants ' cottages , an endless and orderly array of outhouses , long grape arbors , green pastures , orchards , and berry patches .\nThen there was the pumping plant for the artesian well , and the big cement tank where Judge Miller 's boys took their morning plunge and kept cool in the hot afternoon .\nAnd over this great demesne Buck ruled .\nHere he was born , and here he had lived the four years of his life .\nIt was true , there were other dogs , There could not but be other dogs on so vast a place , but they did not count .\nThey came and went , resided in the populous kennels , or lived obscurely in the recesses of the house after the fashion of Toots , the Japanese pug , or Ysabel , the Mexican hairless , -- strange creatures that rarely put nose out of doors or set foot to ground .\nOn the other hand , there were the fox terriers , a score of them at least , who yelped fearful promises at Toots and Ysabel looking out of the windows at them and protected by a legion of housemaids armed with brooms and mops .\nBut Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog .\nThe whole realm was his .\nHe plunged into the swimming tank or went hunting with the Judge 's sons ; he escorted Mollie and Alice , the Judge 's daughters , on long twilight or early morning rambles ; on wintry nights he lay at the Judge 's feet before the roaring library fire ; he carried the Judge 's grandsons on his back , or rolled them in the grass , and guarded their footsteps through wild adventures down to the fountain in the stable yard , and even beyond , where the paddocks were , and the berry patches .\nAmong the terriers he stalked imperiously , and Toots and Ysabel he utterly ignored , for he was king , -- king over all creeping , crawling , flying things of Judge Miller 's place , humans included .\nHis father , Elmo , a huge St. Bernard , had been the Judge 's inseparable companion , and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father .\nHe was not so large , -- he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds , -- for his mother , Shep , had been a Scotch shepherd dog .\nNevertheless , one hundred and forty pounds , to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect , enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion .\nDuring the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat ; he had a fine pride in himself , was even a trifle egotistical , as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation .\nBut he had saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog .\nHunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles ; and to him , as to the cold-tubbing races , the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver .\nAnd this was the manner of dog Buck was in the fall of 1897 , when the Klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen North .\nBut Buck did not read the newspapers , and he did not know that Manuel , one of the gardener 's helpers , was an undesirable acquaintance .\nManuel had one besetting sin .\nHe loved to play Chinese lottery .\nAlso , in his gambling , he had one besetting weakness -- faith in a system ; and this made his damnation certain .\nFor to play a system requires money , while the wages of a gardener 's helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and numerous progeny .\nThe Judge was at a meeting of the Raisin Growers ' Association , and the boys were busy organizing an athletic club , on the memorable night of Manuel 's treachery .\nNo one saw him and Buck go off through the orchard on what Buck imagined was merely a stroll .\nAnd with the exception of a solitary man , no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known as College Park .\nThis man talked with Manuel , and money chinked between them .\n“ You might wrap up the goods before you deliver 'm , ” the stranger said gruffly , and Manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around Buck 's neck under the collar .\n“ Twist it , an ' you 'll choke 'm plentee , ” said Manuel , and the stranger grunted a ready affirmative .\nBuck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity .\nTo be sure , it was an unwonted performance : but he had learned to trust in men he knew , and to give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own .\nBut when the ends of the rope were placed in the stranger 's hands , he growled menacingly .\nHe had merely intimated his displeasure , in his pride believing that to intimate was to command .\nBut to his surprise the rope tightened around his neck , shutting off his breath .\nIn quick rage he sprang at the man , who met him halfway , grappled him close by the throat , and with a deft twist threw him over on his back .\nThen the rope tightened mercilessly , while Buck struggled in a fury , his tongue lolling out of his mouth and his great chest panting futilely .\nNever in all his life had he been so vilely treated , and never in all his life had he been so angry .\nBut his strength ebbed , his eyes glazed , and he knew nothing when the train was flagged and the two men threw him into the baggage car .\nThe next he knew , he was dimly aware that his tongue was hurting and that he was being jolted along in some kind of a conveyance .\nThe hoarse shriek of a locomotive whistling a crossing told him where he was .\nHe had travelled too often with the Judge not to know the sensation of riding in a baggage car .\nHe opened his eyes , and into them came the unbridled anger of a kidnapped king .\nThe man sprang for his throat , but Buck was too quick for him .\nHis jaws closed on the hand , nor did they relax till his senses were choked out of him once more .\n“ Yep , has fits , ” the man said , hiding his mangled hand from the baggageman , who had been attracted by the sounds of struggle .\n“ I 'm takin ' 'm up for the boss to ' Frisco .\nA crack dog-doctor there thinks that he can cure 'm . ”\nConcerning that night 's ride , the man spoke most eloquently for himself , in a little shed back of a saloon on the San Francisco water front .\n“ All I get is fifty for it , ” he grumbled ; “ an ' I would n't do it over for a thousand , cold cash . ”\nHis hand was wrapped in a bloody handkerchief , and the right trouser leg was ripped from knee to ankle .\n“ How much did the other mug get ? ”\nthe saloon-keeper demanded .\n“ A hundred , ” was the reply .\n“ Would n't take a sou less , so help me . ”\n“ That makes a hundred and fifty , ” the saloon-keeper calculated ; “ and he 's worth it , or I 'm a squarehead . ”\nThe kidnapper undid the bloody wrappings and looked at his lacerated hand .\n“ If I do n't get the hydrophoby -- ” “ It 'll be because you was born to hang , ” laughed the saloon-keeper .\n“ Here , lend me a hand before you pull your freight , ” he added .\nDazed , suffering intolerable pain from throat and tongue , with the life half throttled out of him , Buck attempted to face his tormentors .\nBut he was thrown down and choked repeatedly , till they succeeded in filing the heavy brass collar from off his neck .\nThen the rope was removed , and he was flung into a cagelike crate .\nThere he lay for the remainder of the weary night , nursing his wrath and wounded pride .\nHe could not understand what it all meant .\nWhat did they want with him , these strange men ?\nWhy were they keeping him pent up in this narrow crate ?\nHe did not know why , but he felt oppressed by the vague sense of impending calamity .\nSeveral times during the night he sprang to his feet when the shed door rattled open , expecting to see the Judge , or the boys at least .\nBut each time it was the bulging face of the saloon-keeper that peered in at him by the sickly light of a tallow candle .\nAnd each time the joyful bark that trembled in Buck 's throat was twisted into a savage growl .\nBut the saloon-keeper let him alone , and in the morning four men entered and picked up the crate .\nMore tormentors , Buck decided , for they were evil-looking creatures , ragged and unkempt ; and he stormed and raged at them through the bars .\nThey only laughed and poked sticks at him , which he promptly assailed with his teeth till he realized that that was what they wanted .\nWhereupon he lay down sullenly and allowed the crate to be lifted into a wagon .\nThen he , and the crate in which he was imprisoned , began a passage through many hands .\nClerks in the express office took charge of him ; he was carted about in another wagon ; a truck carried him , with an assortment of boxes and parcels , upon a ferry steamer ; he was trucked off the steamer into a great railway depot , and finally he was deposited in an express car .\n",
